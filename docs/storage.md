# Storage in XCP-ng

Storage in XCP-ng is a quite large topic. This section is dedicated to it. Keywords are:

* SR: Storage Repository, the place for your VM disks (VDI SR)
* VDI: a virtual disk
* ISO SR: special SR only for ISO files (in read only)

Please take in consideration that Xen API (XAPI) via their storage module (`SMAPI`) is doing all the heavy lifting on your storage. **You don't need to format drives manually**.

:::tip
We encourage people to use file based SR (local ext, NFS, XOSANâ€¦) because it's easier to deal with. If you want to know more, read the rest.
:::

## Storage types

There are two types of storage:

* Thin Provisioned: you only use the space your VM has filled with data
* Thick Provisioned: you use the space of your VMs disk(s) size.

In addition to this, storage can be either local or shared between hosts of a pool.

There are storage types that are officially supported, and others that are provided as-is, in the hope that they are useful to you. Actually, we do maintain them too, but they receive less testing than the officially supported ones.

:::warning
Cost of thick provisioning is relatively high when you do snapshots (used for backup). If you can use a thin provisioned storage instead, such as Local EXT or NFS, you'll save a LOT of space.
:::

### Local

A local SR is using a disk or a partition of your local disk, to create a space for your VM disks. Local LVM will use logical volumes, whereas Local EXT will create an `ext4` filesystem and put `.vhd` files in it.

:::tip
The concept is simple: tell XCP-ng which disk or partition you want to use, and it will do everything for you! Don't do anything yourself (no need to create a logical volume or a filesystem)
:::

In [Xen Orchestra](management.md#xen-orchestra):

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/createSRlocal.png)

Via `xe` CLI for a local EXT SR (where `sdaX` is a partition, but it can be the entire device e.g. `sdc`):

```
xe sr-create host-uuid=<host UUID> type=ext content-type=user name-label="Local Ext" device-config:device=/dev/sdaX
```

In addition to the two main, rock-solid, local storages (EXT and LVM), XCP-ng offers storage drivers for other types of local storage (ZFS, XFS, etc.).

### NFS

Shared, thin-provisioned storage. Efficient, recommended for ease of maintenance and space savings.

In Xen Orchestra, go in the "New" menu entry, then Storage, and select NFS. Follow instructions from there.  

:::tip
Your host will mount the top-level NFS share you provide initially (example: /share/xen), then create folder(s) inside of that, then mount those directly instead (example: /share/xen/515982ab-476e-17b7-0e61-e68fef8d7d31). This means your NFS server or appliance must be set to allow sub-directory mounts, or adding the SR will fail. In FreeNAS, this checkbox is called "All dirs" in the NFS share properties.
:::

### File

Local, thin-provisioned. Not recommended.

The `file` storage driver allows you to use any local directory as storage. 

Example:
```
xe sr-create host-uuid=<host UUID> type=file content-type=user name-label="Local File SR" device-config:location=/path/to/storage
```

Avoid using it with mountpoints for remote storage: if for some reason the filesystem is not mounted when the SR is scanned for virtual disks, the `file` driver will believe that the SR is empty and drop all VDI metadata for that storage.

### XOSANv2

Shared, thin-provisioned storage.

XOSANv2 is an hyperconvergence solution. In short, your local storage are combined into a big shared storage.

:::tip
XOSANv2 is coming soon in XCP-ng. Hang on!
:::

### ZFS

Local, thin-provisioned. Available since XCP-ng 8.2.

Due to the variety of parameters of ZFS, the SR driver does not automate everything. You need to create your ZFS pool and volumes yourself, e.g. on partition `sda4`:

```
zpool create -o ashift=12 -m /mnt/zfs tank /dev/sda4
```

Now you can create the SR on top of it:

```
xe sr-create host-uuid=<HOST_UUID> type=zfs content-type=user name-label=LocalZFS device-config:location=/mnt/zfs/
```

For better performance, you can disable sync with `zfs set sync=disabled tank`.

:::tip
Please report any problems (performance or otherwise) you might encounter with ZFS. [Our forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum) is here for that!
:::

:::warning
Note: If you use ZFS, assign at least 16GB RAM to avoid swapping. ZFS (in standard configuration) uses half the Dom0 RAM as cache!
:::

#### ZFS Knowledge & status

Do not hesitate to take a look at these links for more advanced explanations:

* Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS>
* OpenZFS Basics: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsY-BafQgj4>
* Blog full of useful information: <http://www.zfsbuild.com>

You can monitor your ZFS pool using:

```
# Get the global status.
zpool status

# More info concerning the performance.
zpool iostat -v 1
```

#### ZFS module parameters

To get the list of supported parameters, you can execute:

```
man zfs-module-parameters
```

It's possible to write/read parameters on the fly. For example:

```
# Read zfs_txg_timeout param.
cat /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_txg_timeout
5
# Write zfs_txg_timeout param.
echo 10 > /sys/module/zfs/parameters/zfs_txg_timeout
```

#### Better performance (advanced options)

There are many options to increase the performance of ZFS SRs:

* Modify the module parameter `zfs_txg_timeout`: Flush dirty data to disk at least every N seconds (maximum txg duration). By default 5.
* Disable sync to disk: `zfs set sync=disabled tank/zfssr`
* Turn on compression (it's cheap but effective): `zfs set compress=lz4 tank/zfssr`
* Disable accesstime log: `zfs set atime=off tank/zfssr`

### XFS

Local, thin-provisioned storage.

:::tip
[Additional package](additionalpackages.md) required and available in our repositories: `xfsprogs`.

On XCP-ng before 8.2, you also need `sm-additional-drivers`.
:::

Works in the same way as the Local EXT storage driver: you hand it a device and it will format it and prepare it for your VMs automatically.

Via `xe` CLI for a local XFS SR (where `sdaX` is a partition, but it can be the entire device e.g. `sdc`):

```
xe sr-create host-uuid=<host UUID> type=xfs content-type=user name-label="Local XFS" device-config:device=/dev/sdaX
```

### Glusterfs

Shared, thin-provisioned storage. Available since XCP-ng 8.2.

:::tip
[Additional package](additionalpackages.md) required and available in our repositories: `glusterfs-server`.
:::

You can use this driver to connect to an existing [Gluster storage](https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/) volume and configure it as a shared SR for all your hosts in the pool. For example, a Gluster storage with 3 nodes (`192.168.1.11`, `192.168.1.12` and `192.168.1.13`) and a volume name called `glustervolume` will be thin provisioned with the command:

```
xe sr-create content-type=user type=glusterfs name-label=GlusterSharedStorage shared=true device-config:server=192.168.1.11:/glustervolume device-config:backupservers=192.168.1.12:192.168.1.13
```

### CephFS

Shared, thin-provisioned storage. Available since XCP-ng 8.2.

:::warning
This way of using Ceph requires installing `ceph-common` inside dom0 from outside the official XCP-ng repositories. It is reported to be working by some users, but isn't recommended officially (see [Additional packages](additionalpackages.md)). You will also need to be careful about system updates and upgrades.
:::

You can use this driver to connect to an existing Ceph storage filesystem, and configure it as a shared SR for all your hosts in the pool. This driver uses `mount.ceph` from `ceph-common` package of `centos-release-ceph-nautilus` repo. So user needs to install it before creating the SR. Without it, the SR creation would fail with an error like below
```
Error code: SR_BACKEND_FAILURE_47
Error parameters: , The SR is not available [opterr=ceph is not installed],
```

Installation steps
```
# yum install centos-release-ceph-nautilus --enablerepo=extras
# yum install ceph-common --enablerepo=base
```

Create `/etc/ceph/admin.secret` with your access secret for CephFS.
```
# cat /etc/ceph/admin.secret
AQBX21dfVMJtBhAA2qthmLyp7Wxz+T5YgoxzeQ==
```

Now you can create the SR where `server` is your mon ip.
```
# xe sr-create type=cephfs name-label=ceph device-config:server=172.16.10.10 device-config:serverpath=/xcpsr device-config:options=name=admin,secretfile=/etc/ceph/admin.secret
```

:::tip
* For `serverpath` it would be good idea to use an empty folder from the CephFS instead of `/`.
* You may specify `serverport` option if you are using any other port than 6789.
* Do not use admin keyring for production, but make a separate key with only necessary privileges https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/operations/user-management/
:::

### iSCSI

Shared, thick-provisioned storage.

In Xen Orchestra, go in the "New" menu entry, then Storage, and select iSCSI. Follow instructions from there.

### HBA

Shared, thick-provisioned storage.

You can add a Host Bus Adapter (HBA) storage device with `xe`:

```
xe sr-create content-type=user shared=true type=lvmohba name-label=MyHBAStorage device-config:SCSIid=<the SCSI id>
```

This is great for passing through full hardware disks, such as an entire hard disk.

If you have a problem with the SCSIid, you can use this alternative, carefully selecting the right drive, and checking it's visible on all hosts with the same name:

```
xe sr-create content-type=user shared=true type=lvmohba name-label=MyHBAStorage device-config:device=/dev/<HBA drive>
```

### Ceph iSCSI gateway

:::warning
Experimental, this needs reliable testing to ensure no block corruption happens in regular use.
:::

This is at this moment the only way to connect to Ceph with no modifications of dom0, it's possible to create multiple Ceph iSCSI gateways following this: <https://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/rbd/iscsi-target-cli/>

Ceph iSCSI gateway node(s) sits outside dom0, probably another Virtual or Physical machine. The packages referred in the URL are to be installed on iSCSI gateway node(s). For XCP-ng dom0, no modifications are needed as it would use LVMoISCSISR (lvmoiscsi) driver to access the iSCSI LUN presented by these gateways.

For some reason the chap authentication between gwcli and XCP-ng doesn't seem to be working, so it's recommended to disable it (in case you use no authentication a dedicated network for storage should be used to ensure some security).

IMPORTANT: User had many weird glitches with iSCSI connection via ceph gateway in lab setup (3 gateways and 3 paths on each host) after several days of using it. So please keep in mind that this setup is experimental and unstable. This would have to be retested on recent XCP-ng.

### Ceph RBD

:::warning
This way of using Ceph requires installing `ceph-common` inside dom0 from outside the official XCP-ng repositories. It is reported to be working by some users, but isn't recommended officially (see [Additional packages](additionalpackages.md)). You will also need to be careful about system updates and upgrades.
:::

You can use this to connect to an existing Ceph storage over RBD, and configure it as a shared SR for all your hosts in the pool. This driver uses LVM (lvm) as generic driver and expects that the Ceph RBD volume is already connected to one or more hosts.

Known issue: this SR is not allowed to be used for HA state metadata due to LVM backend restrictions within XAPI drivers, so if you want to use HA, you will need to create another type of storage for HA metadata

Installation steps

```
# yum install centos-release-ceph-nautilus --enablerepo=extras
# yum install ceph-common --enablerepo=base
```

Create `/etc/ceph/keyring` with your access secret for Ceph.

```
# cat /etc/ceph/keyring 
[client.admin]
key = AQBX21dfVMJtJhAA2qthmLyp7Wxz+T5YgoxzeQ==
```

Create `/etc/ceph/ceph.conf` as your matching setup.

```
# cat /etc/ceph/ceph.conf 
[global]
mon_host = 10.10.10.10:6789

[client.admin]
keyring = /etc/ceph/keyring
```

```
rbd create --size 300G --image-feature layering pool/xen1

# Map it to all xen hosts in your pool
rbd map pool/xen1

# edit /etc/lvm/lvm.conf and /etc/lvm/master/lvm.conf on all nodes and add this option
# otherwise LVM will ignore the rbd block device
types = [ "rbd", 1024 ]

# create a shared LVM
xe sr-create name-label='CEPH' shared=true device-config:device=/dev/rbd/rbd/xen1 type=lvm content-type=user
```

You will probably want to configure ceph further so that the block device is mapped on reboot.

For the full discussion about Ceph in XCP-ng, see this forum thread: <https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/4/ceph-on-xcp-ng>

## ISO SR

You might wonder: how to upload an ISO? Unlike other solutions, you need to create a dedicated "space" for those, a specific ISO SR. To create one, it's pretty easy: in Xen Orchestra, go into "New/Storage" and select "ISO SR":

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/createSRISO.png)

Usually, you can use a NFS or SMB share. But if you don't have any of those, you can rely on a local ISO SR that you create yourself:

1. Select "Local" instead of NFS/SMB
2. Enter a path that already exists on your physical host
3. Upload ISO on your host to the same path

That's it!

:::tip
Don't forget to rescan your SR after adding ISO files. Rescan is done automatically every 10 minutes otherwise.
:::

## Storage API

Current storage stack on XCP-ng is called `SMAPIv1`. The VHD format is used, which has a maximum file size limitation of 2TiB. This means that when using this format your VM disk can't be larger than 2TiB.

### Why use VHD format?

Mostly for historical reasons. When standardization on [VHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHD_(file_format)) was decided, it was the only acceptable format that supported [copy on write](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write), delta capabilities, and merge possibilities. Thanks to VHD format, you have:

* snapshot support
* delta backup
* fast clone VM
* live storage migration

### Using RAW format

Alternatively, you can decide to use a disk without 2TiB limitation, thanks to RAW format. However, the price to pay is to lose all VHD features.

To create a large VDI on a file based SR, it's trivial, for example:

```
xe vdi-create type=user sm-config:type=raw virtual-size=5TiB sr-uuid=<SR_UUID> name-label=test
```

On a block based storage, it's a bit more complicated:

1. Create a small disk first: `xe vdi-create type=user sm-config:type=raw virtual-size=1GiB sr-uuid=<SR_UUID> name-label=test`
2. Extend it with `lvextend -L+5T /dev/VG_<whateverUUID>/LV-<VDI_UUID>`
3. Rescan SR

:::warning
You won't be able to live migrate storage on this disk or snapshot it anymore. Outside of this, it will work very well.
:::

### SMAPIv3: the future

`SMAPIv1` is the historical storage interface, and now a big spaghetti monster. That's why Citrix decided to create a new one, called `SMAPIv3`: it's far more flexible, and also support (partially) the `qcow2` format. This format has the same concepts as VHD, but without its limitations.

Also, the storage API is far more agnostic and the code is better. So what's the catch? Problem is there's no Open Source implementation of `SMAPIv3`, also the current API state isn't really complete (doesn't support a lot of features). However, XCP-ng team is working on it too, because it's clearly the future!

## Coalesce

Coalesce process is an operation happening in your hosts as soon a snapshot is removed.

When you make a snapshot, a "base copy" is created (in read only), the "active" disk will live its own life, same for the freshly created snapshot. Example here: A is the parent, B the current/active disk and C is the snapshot:

![](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/content/images/2017/05/legendsnap.png)

![](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/content/images/2017/05/snapshot1.png)

That's OK. But what about creating a new snapshot on B after some data are written?

You got this:

![](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/content/images/2017/05/beforemerge.png)

When you make XO backup on regular basis, old/unused snapshots will be removed automatically. This will also happen if you create/delete snapshots manually. So in our case, C will disappear. And without this snapshot, XCP-ng will coalesce A and B:

![](https://xen-orchestra.com/blog/content/images/2017/05/parent.png)

This process will take some time to finish (especially if you VM stays up and worst if you have a lot of writes on its disks).

**What about creating snapshot (ie call backup jobs) faster than XCP-ng can coalesce?** Well, the chain will continue to grow. And more you have disks to merge, longer it will take.

You will hit a wall, 2 options here:

* if your VM disks are small enough, you could reach the max chain length (30).
* if your VM disks are big, you'll hit the SR space limit before.

### Xen Orchestra protection

Luckily, Xen Orchestra is able to detect an uncoalesced chain. It means it won't trigger a backup job for a VM if its disks are not coalesced yet: it will be skipped.

But more than that, Xen Orchestra is also able to show you uncoalesced disk in the SR view, in the Advanced tab.
