# Project

XCP-ng is not just a "product" or a solution, it's also a great project with a great community!

A long time ago there was the free hypervisor [Xen Cloud Platform - XCP](https://wiki.xen.org/wiki/XCP_Overview) and its commercial version Citrix XenServer. Later Citrix open sourced XenServer, so XCP was no longer needed and discontinued.

But since XenServer 7.3, Citrix removed a lot of features from the free version. The project founder Olivier Lambert wanted to have a free, community based, unrestricted open source hypervisor with the spirit of XCP and so he called his new project `XCP New Generation`, in short XCP-ng.

The goal of XCP-ng is to make a fully community backed version of XenServer, without any feature restrictions.

## Community

Most of the community is on [XCP-ng Forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum). Feel free go there and ask anything!

There's also a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/xcpng) and an IRC channel available on Freenode: #xcp-ng
