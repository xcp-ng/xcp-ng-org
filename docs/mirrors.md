# Mirrors

Like a Linux distribution, XCP-ng's installation images and RPM repositories can be replicated by benevolent mirror providers.

Starting with its 8.0 release, XCP-ng uses [mirrorbits](https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits) to redirect download requests to an appropriate mirror based on their update status and geographical position.

## Original mirror

`http://mirrors.xcp-ng.org` is the base URL for all download links, either downloads of installation ISO images, or RPM repositories used by `yum` to download updates.

Previous versions of XCP-ng downloaded files directly from `https://updates.xcp-ng.org`, which now becomes one mirror among others (and a fallback in case of files missing from other mirrors).

## List of mirrors

You can check our live list of mirrors at this URL: [https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/?mirrorstats](https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/?mirrorstats)

## Add your mirror

Anyone or any entity can submit a mirror to our approval so that we add it to the list used by mirrorbits. It is a way to contribute to the XCP-ng project!

### Prerequisites

In order to guarantee the quality of the mirrors offered to our users, there a some prerequisites:
* Offer HTTP (more convenient than anonymous FTP for mirrors nowadays), or HTTPS.
  * Note: HTTPS is required for downloads of installation ISO images, because recent browsers tend to refuse any HTTPS to HTTP downgrade. If you mirror only provides HTTP, it can still be used for downloading RPMs from XCP-ng hosts, since every RPM is GPG-signed. HTTPS may become a requirement for this too in the future.
  * If you offer HTTPS, you need a valid certificate and must renew it in time to avoid downtime.
  * If you already provided a mirror but are unsure if we added it as an HTTP or HTTPS mirror, check http://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/README.txt?mirrorlist&https=1, which selects HTTPS mirrors and lists the others in an "Excluded Mirrors" section.
* Offer read-only `rsync`. Two reasons:
  * Mirrorbits needs this to regularly check the state of the mirror and automatically disable outdated or broken mirrors.
  * This will allow nearby mirrors to sync from yours in the future, if needed.
* Sync from a quickly updated mirror (the first mirrors will sync from our main mirror) at least twice an hour, preferably four times an hour.
* Sync the whole mirror tree (we may reconsider this prerequisite when the mirror grows). On August 2021, the total size (XCP-ng 7.4 to 8.2) was 50 GiB.
* Provision enough disk space for future growth, and monitor available space to avoid sync failures.
* Minimum bandwidth: 100 Mbit/s. Preferably 1 Gbit/s. At some point, we may refuse applications that offer only 100 Mbit/s in areas with already enough quicker mirrors available.
* Up 24/24.

If one of those prerequisites is causing an issue to you as a mirror provider, tell us.

### How to sync

Here's how to sync from the main mirror. Adapt if syncing from another mirror.
```
rsync -rlptv --delete-delay updates.xcp-ng.org::repo/ /local/path/to/mirror
```

Note: rsync access will be unlocked for your host after your application, see below.

### Send your application

Send an e-mail to mirrors (AT) xcp-ng [DOT] org, following the example below:

Subject: "Mirror application for mymirror.example.com".

Body:
```
Server name: mymirror.example.com
City: Paris
Country: France
Bandwidth: 1 Gbit/s
Source mirror: updates.xcp-ng.org
Host or IP to authorize: mymirror.example.com
Sync frequency: every 15 min
HTTP(S) URL: http://mymirror.example.com/
RSYNC URL: rsync://mymirror.example.com/xcp-ng/
Other prerequisites from https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/wiki/Mirrors checked: yes
```

"Source mirror" is the mirror you will sync from. At this stage, we suggest that the source always be `updates.xcp-ng.org` which is the main, most up to date, mirror. Rsync is restricted by default on this mirror, so we need you to provide either a hostname or an IP address access that will we allowed to sync from that mirror (Hence the "Host or IP to authorize:..." line above).

Ask any question.

## Security

### Context

When you download something from the internet, there is always a chance that the file you get has been corrupted by the transfer, or worse altered voluntarily by someone with malicious intentions.

So for important files, a good habit is to check the file against a [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the file. Usually the (quite weak) `MD5` hash function, or something stronger like `SHA256`.

**But what if someone also modified the hash file?**

This is a valid concern: maybe you are downloading from a mirror whose owner you don't trust fully, or maybe the server you are downloading from has been hacked. If someone managed to modify the file you want to download, they probably also modified the hash file too. That's where we need [cryptographic signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature). Files can be signed with a private key, and you can use the corresponding public key to check the validity of the signature.

### In XCP-ng

Since XCP-ng 7.6, we use [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) to sign:
* SHA256 sums for installation ISOs
* SHA256 sums for repository configuration files (`xcp-ng-X.Y.repo`, downloaded as part of the [upgrade process](upgrade.md) if you choose to use `yum` to upgrade)
* Every RPM package. They are automatically checked by `rpm` on an installed XCP-ng.
* Repository metadata. They are automatically checked by `yum` on an installed XCP-ng.

#### Import the public key

Before you can use our public key to verify the authenticity of a downloaded file, you need to import it.

Download the key
```
wget https://xcp-ng.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng
```

A key is of no use if you can't trust it. So check its fingerprint.
```
gpg --quiet --with-fingerprint RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng
```

Expected output:
```
pub  2048R/3FD3AC9E 2018-10-03 XCP-ng Key (XCP-ng Official Signing Key) <security@xcp-ng.org>
      Key fingerprint = 34AC 2EB6 8248 FED6 D076  838A CD75 783A 3FD3 AC9E
sub  2048R/2EB0DF19 2018-10-03
```

If your version of gpg doesn't display fingerprints anymore, try instead:
```
gpg --import --import-options show-only RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng
```
with expected output:
```
pub   rsa2048 2018-10-03 [SC]
      34AC2EB68248FED6D076838ACD75783A3FD3AC9E
uid                      XCP-ng Key (XCP-ng Official Signing Key) <security@xcp-ng.org>
sub   rsa2048 2018-10-03 [E]
```

Note: if you fear that someone altered this document as part of a sophisticated attack,
you can also check that the fingerprint stored in our GitHub repository is the same:
<https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp-ng-release/blob/master/RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng-info.txt>
(and in case you think someone might have altered the above link, check that the repository does actually belong to the XCP-ng project).

Now import the key with `gpg`:
```
gpg --import RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng
```

#### Check a downloaded file
The signature for `somefile` is stored in `somefile.asc`. Download both, then:
```
gpg --verify somefile.asc somefile
```

Expected output:
```
# gpg: Signature made Wed 10 Oct 2018 12:50:06 PM CEST using RSA key ID 3FD3AC9E
# gpg: Good signature from "XCP-ng Key (XCP-ng Official Signing Key) <security@xcp-ng.org>"
# gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
# gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
# Primary key fingerprint: 34AC 2EB6 8248 FED6 D076  838A CD75 783A 3FD3 AC9E
```
Only the date should change depending on the date of signature. **`Good Signature`** is what tells us that the verification is successful. The warning is also expected because the signing key itself is not signed and we've not setup a list of trusted sources on the computer, so there's no way for gpg to tell if the key is to be trusted or not.

#### Check an ISO image
In this example we will first check the authenticity of the SHA256SUMS file, then use it to check the integrity of the ISO image. We'll download `xcp-ng-7.6.0.iso`, `SHA256SUMS` and `SHA256SUMS.asc` from <https://updates.xcp-ng.org/isos/7.6/> but you can transpose those steps to a newer ISO.

First: import the GPG key if not done already (see above).

Verify the authenticity of the `SHA256SUMS` file.
```
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
```

Now that we trust the authenticity of the `SHA256SUMS` file, let's check the integrity of the `.iso` file.
```
LC_ALL=C sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK
```

It should display:
```
xcp-ng-7.6.0.iso: OK
```


#### Check a repository (`.repo`) file
This is exactly the same as for the `.iso` file above: we provided a `SHA256SUMS` and a `SHA256SUMS.asc` file.

First: import the GPG key if not done already. You can follow the steps above, but if you are on an XCP-ng 7.6 or newer, you can take a shortcut because the key file is already on your system: `gpg --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng`

Example with `xcp-ng-7.6.repo`:
```
wget https://updates.xcp-ng.org/7/xcp-ng-7.6.repo -O xcp-ng-7.6.repo
wget https://updates.xcp-ng.org/7/SHA256SUMS -O SHA256SUMS
wget https://updates.xcp-ng.org/7/SHA256SUMS.asc -O SHA256SUMS.asc
```

Verify the authenticity of the `SHA256SUMS` file.
```
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
```

Now that we trust the authenticity of the `SHA256SUMS` file, let's check the integrity of the `.repo` file.
```
LC_ALL=C sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS 2>&1 | grep OK
```

It should display:
```
xcp-ng-7.6.repo: OK
```

### About repository metadata and RPMs
Those are signed with the same key, but you don't need to verify them manually: since XCP-ng 7.6, the key is installed directly on the system and used by `yum` and `rpm` each time you update or install packages from the repositories of XCP-ng.

This is defined for each subrepository (`xcp-ng-base`, `xcp-ng-updates`, `xcp-ng-extras`, etc.) by the following variables in `/etc/yum.repos.d/xcp-ng.repo`:
```
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-xcpng
```
* `gpgcheck=1` means that the signature of every RPM that comes from this repository must be verified. Protects against malicious changes to the RPMs on the mirrors.
* `repo_gpgcheck=1` means that the signature of the repository's `repomd.xml` must be verified before using the repository. Protects against malicious changes to the repository metadata, such as replacing a recent RPM with an older, security-flawed, signed RPM.
* `gpgkey` is the URL to the local file containing the GPG public key used for verifying the signatures.
