(*) Support for XCP-ng 8.2 LTS was extended for a short period to ensure a three-month gap between the official LTS release of XCP-ng 8.3 and the end of support for XCP-ng 8.2 LTS.

## ðŸŸ¢ LTS Releases

*Latest LTS: [XCP-ng 8.3](release-8-3.md)*

Using the Long Term Support version is recommended if:

* you want to ensure system stability
* you prefer receiving security fixes without needing to perform major upgrades annually
* you need a predictable migration path over a longer timeframe
* you are not concerned about missing new features for a few years

XCP-ng's LTS releases are typically supported for up to five years. However, XCP-ng 8.3 is an exception: it will be supported until 2028-11-30 to make way for the next major release, XCP-ng 9.0.

```

## ðŸŸ¡ Standard Release

*Latest: [XCP-ng 8.3](release-8-3.md) (somehow)*

Using the standard release is recommended if:

* you want access to the latest features and enhancements
* you need support for the newest hardware
* you want to benefit from improved performance

Standard releases are supported until the next release, plus a few additional months to allow time for transitioning. Check the support dates [in the table above](#xcp-ng-release-history).

If you prefer a more conservative approach, consider choosing our [LTS release](#-lts-releases).

:::note
XCP-ng 8.3 is special, as it started as a standard release, then became as announced a LTS release in June 2025.

XCP-ng 9.0 might follow the same path.

## ðŸ”´ Pre Releases

Using a pre-release is relevant only for testing purposes. Check [the `Release` tag on our blog](https://xcp-ng.org/blog/tag/release/) for (pre-)release announcements.

:::warning
### Important Note on Pre-Releases

Pre-releases are designed for testing before final General Availability. Although generally stable, they are **NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE**. Key considerations include:

* Security Patches: Pre-releases may not receive urgent security updates as promptly as production-grade releases.
* Commercial Support: Vates does not offer commercial support for pre-releases until they are officially finalized.

For these reasons, pre-releases should be used strictly for testing.
