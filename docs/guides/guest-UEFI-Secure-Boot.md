# Guest UEFI Secure Boot

How to configure UEFI Secure boot?

Enabling UEFI Secure Boot for guests ensures that XCP-ng VMs will only execute trusted binaries at boot. In practice, these are the binaries released by the operating system (OS) vendor for the OS running in the VM (Microsoft Windows, Debian, RHEL, Alpine, etc.).

## Upcoming changes in guest Secure Boot

The default guest Secure Boot keys in XCP-ng are changing.

Previously, XCP-ng only shipped with the PK included by default; Secure Boot variables had to be installed using `secureboot-certs`.
New versions of XCP-ng's `varstored` (from version 1.2.0-2.4 and newer) now come with a complete set of Secure Boot variables (PK/KEK/db/dbx) by default, meaning that guest Secure Boot will now work for new VMs without needing further pool configuration.

Our defaults now include the 2023 Microsoft KEK and db certificates, ensuring Secure Boot updates beyond 2026 (which is when the previous 2011 certificates expire). These defaults will also be automatically kept up-to-date as XCP-ng is updated.

### What this change means for you

You will not be affected in most cases.

* Existing VMs will not be affected unless you use the [Propagate certificates](#propagate-pool-certificates-to-a-vm) feature in Xen Orchestra (which has always had the effect of resetting VM Secure Boot variables to that of the pool).
* If you followed our previous guides and used `secureboot-certs install` to install the default Secure Boot variables into your pool, these variables will not be changed.

Here are the changes in detail:

* If you haven't manually configured Secure Boot variables on your pool, your pool now supports guest Secure Boot by default.
* From now on, we recommend keeping the pool Secure Boot variables default so that XCP-ng updates could keep them up-to-date.
  * If you have installed your pool SB variables using `secureboot-certs install`, use `secureboot-certs clear` to reset them.
  * Existing VMs will not be affected.
* We now include the 2023 Microsoft KEK certificate for guest-initiated security updates to the db and dbx variables.
  * After updating the pool variables, you can add this certificate to existing VMs using the [Propagate certificates](#propagate-pool-certificates-to-a-vm) procedure.

    :warning: **Danger**, risk of data loss: Propagating certificates to an existing VM will change its Secure Boot vTPM measurements. If you depend on these measurements (e.g. BitLocker with TPM protector), you must carefully read the [Preparing for Secure Boot Variable Changes](#preparing-for-secure-boot-variable-changes) procedure.

## Requirements

* XCP-ng >= 8.2.1.
* UEFI Secure Boot Certificates installed on the pool (this is detailed below).
* A UEFI guest VM.

:::warning
Until we can re-sign XCP-ng's PV drivers for Windows, you will need the PV drivers from XenServer before enabling Secure Boot for a Windows VM. See [Setup Secure Boot for Windows VMs](#setup-secure-boot-for-windows-vms).
:::

Note: it's not necessary that the XCP-ng host boots in UEFI mode for Secure Boot to be enabled on VMs.

## 8.3 with varstored >= 1.2.0-2.4

Secure Boot is ready to use on new VMs without extra configuration. Simply activate Secure Boot on your VMs, and they will be provided with an appropriate set of default Secure Boot variables.

We will keep updating the default Secure Boot variables with future updates from Microsoft. If you don't want this behavior, you can lock in these variables by using the [Manually Install the Default UEFI Certificates](#manually-install-the-default-uefi-certificates) procedure.

## 8.2.1 and 8.3 with varstored < 1.2.0-2.4

These versions of XCP-ng require manual configuration to enable Secure Boot.

We believe that reading this guide will provide you with useful knowledge about the way Guest Secure Boot is handled in XCP-ng, and let you avoid mistakes.

However, for those who would like to take a shortcut, here's how to set it up on a new pool.

* Run `secureboot-certs install` to [install the default UEFI certificates to your pool](#manually-install-the-default-uefi-certificates).
* From now on, any new UEFI VM will be initialized with these certificates, the first time it boots.
* For any VM which was already initialized before the operation (booted at least once before):
  * If it was started before UEFI certificates were installed on the pool, manually [trigger the certificate propagation](#propagate-pool-certificates-to-a-vm).
  * If it comes from another pool (via migration, export/import, or a backup restore handled by Xen Orchestra) and had already been setup for UEFI there, no need to do it again. Else, treat it like a VM lacking certificates and also propagate the pool certificates to it.
* Enable Secure Boot on the VMs, using Xen Orchestra, or via command line with `xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm-uuid> platform:secureboot=true`
* Start them and [check the Secure Boot status](#check-uefi-secure-boot-status-from-inside-the-vm).
* Run `secureboot-certs install` again from time to time to [refresh the certificate Revocation List](#secure-boot-and-revoked-certificates) of the pool.

:::warning
Enabling the "Secure Boot" option for a VM does not guarantee that Secure Boot is actually enforced. The reason for this is that the UEFI specification defines a state called *Setup Mode*, where a VM initialized without any Secure Boot certificates will silently ignore any instruction to enforce Secure Boot.

So, to avoid any false sense of security, [check the Secure Boot status for your VMs](#check-uefi-secure-boot-status-from-inside-the-vm) after you first enabled Secure Boot for them.
:::

:::tip
Starting with XCP-ng 8.3, Xen Orchestra was made to help you in the setup of Secure Boot:
- A warning is displayed if you attempt to enable Secure Boot on a pool or VM which are not ready for it due to missing certificates.
- In the VM's *advanced* view, a button lets you propagate the pool UEFI certificates to a VM which needs them.
- The detected Secure Boot status of the VM is displayed.
More about this in [Troubleshoot Guest Secure Boot Issues](#troubleshoot-guest-secure-boot-issues)

## How XCP-ng Manages the Certificates

Let's embark on our journey towards understanding how all this works.

:::tip
To understand UEFI Secure Boot variables (`PK`, `KEK`, `db` and `dbx`), please read James Bottomley's article [The Meaning of all the UEFI Keys](https://blog.hansenpartnership.com/the-meaning-of-all-the-uefi-keys/).

In a few words:
* `PK`: a single X509 key, the Platform Key.
* `KEK`: one or more X509 or RSA2048 keys, the Key Exchange Key.
* `db`: the Signature Database, a list of keys, signatures or hashes. They are used to validate signed EFI binaries and loadable roms.
* `dbx`: the Forbidden Signatures Database or Revocation List, a list of keys, signatures or hashes. They are used to reject binaries or loadable roms even if they were validated using the Signature Database (`db`).

In this guide, we often refer to those 4 UEFI variables as **the Secure Boot certificates**, or simply **the certificates**.
:::

The certificates are stored at several levels:
* **bundled** in the varstored package and managed by XCP-ng updates,
* **pool** level (in the XAPI database),
* host **disk** (it basically mirrors the certificates in the XAPI database),
* **VM** level (in the VM's UEFI variable store).

To install or modify the certificates on the **pool**, use the `secureboot-certs` command line utility. See [Configure the Pool](#configure-the-pool). Once `secureboot-certs` is called, the XAPI DB entry for the pool is populated with a base64-encoded tarball of the UEFI certificates. Note: on XCP-ng 8.2.x, at this stage, *the certificates are still not installed on disk*: they only exist in the XAPI DB*. See "Host disk certificates synchronisation" below.

Host disk certificate synchronization:
- On XCP-ng 8.2.x, the certificates are updated on the host's **disk** (in `/var/lib/uefistored/`) each time a UEFI VM starts on the host, if needed.
- On any more recent release (8.3 or above), the disk certificates (now in `/var/lib/varstored/`) are updated directly when `secureboot-certs install` is run, and again at every XAPI startup afterwards if needed. New hosts joining a pool also directly get a copy of the pool's UEFI certificates, without user intervention.

Pool-level and host-level certificates are here to serve only one purpose: be available for initializing a UEFI VM's EFI variable store with these certificates, so that Secure Boot can be enabled on this VM at the user's convenience. Once the VM is initialized, changes made to the pool's UEFI certificates will **not** be automatically propagated to VMs.

At the VM level:
* Each VM stores a copy of the certificates in its own EFI variable store, initialized the first time it boots.
* These certificates are necessary to enforce Secure Boot: they allow to validate or reject the binaries that boot the Operating System.
* The VM's Operating System may update some of the VM's certificates by itself (Windows updates the revocation list, `dbx`, when needed).
* We provide administrators with tools to [manage a VM's UEFI certificates](#certificate-management) if needed.

## Configure the Pool

For pools with varstored version >= 1.2.0-2.4, no action is required.

For pools with varstored < 1.2.0-2.4, before enabling UEFI Secure Boot for guest VMs, you need to install a set of certificates to the pool using the `secureboot-certs` script on the pool master. This tool downloads, formats, and installs UEFI certificates for the `PK`, `KEK`, `db`, and `dbx` certificates in the XCP-ng pool.

To download and install XCP-ng's default certificates (what almost all users will want), see [Manually Install the Default UEFI Certificates](#manually-install-the-default-uefi-certificates).

For custom certificates (advanced use), see [Install Custom UEFI Certificates](#install-custom-uefi-certificates)

### Manually Install the Default UEFI Certificates

:::info
This procedure is not necessary if you're using varstored 1.2.0-2.4 and newer. However, you can use the procedure anyway to lock in the default variables per pool and avoid further default changes.
:::

`secureboot-certs` supports installing a default set of certificates across the pool.

Except the `PK` key which is already provided by XCP-ng, all certificates are downloaded from official sources (`microsoft.com` and `uefi.org`).

The default certificates are sourced as follows:

**With varstored < 1.2.0-2.4:**

| Certificate |                                                   Source                                                          |  CLI Arg  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| PK          |  Provided by XCP-ng, already present on disk.                                                                     | `default` |
| KEK         |  [Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicCorKEKCA2011_2011-06-24.crt)       | `default` |
| db          |  [Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicCorUEFCA2011_2011-06-27.crt) and [Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011](https://www.microsoft.com/pkiops/certs/MicWinProPCA2011_2011-10-19.crt) | `default` |
| dbx         |  [UEFI Revocation List](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/dbxupdate_x64.bin)                         | `latest`  |

**With varstored >= 1.2.0-2.4:**

All keys are built into varstored-tools and present on disk. There's no need to configure them except for custom Secure Boot scenarios.

Certificate and revocation lists provided by [microsoft/secureboot_objects](https://github.com/microsoft/secureboot_objects).

| Certificate |                                                   Source                                                          |  CLI Arg  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| PK          |  Provided by XCP-ng.                                                                                              | `default` |
| KEK         |  Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011 and Microsoft Corporation KEK 2K CA 2023                                       | `default` |
| db          |  Microsoft Windows Production PCA 2011, Windows UEFI CA 2023, Microsoft Corporation UEFI CA 2011, Microsoft UEFI CA 2023 and Microsoft Option ROM UEFI CA 2023 | `default` |
| dbx         |  Image hashes provided by microsoft/secureboot_objects (can specify `latest` to download latest dbx instead)      | `default` |

To install these variables from the command line interface:

```
# Download and install PK/KEK/db/dbx certificates (varstored < 1.2.0-2.4)
secureboot-certs install default default default latest
# or simply: secureboot-certs install

# Reinstall and lock built-in PK/KEK/db/dbx variables (varstored >= 1.2.0-2.4)
secureboot-certs install

# Go back to XCP-ng-managed defaults (varstored >= 1.2.0-2.4)
secureboot-certs clear
```

If `secureboot-certs` fails to download the certificates from Microsoft due to microsoft.com deciding to forbid downloads from the user agent declared by the script, you may try to download with a different user agent (for example your current browser's user agent):

```
secureboot-certs install --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 My custom user agent"
```

If this still fails, check the next section which explains how to install them manually.

### Install the Default UEFI Certificates Manually (varstored < 1.2.0-2.4)

* Using your web browser, download the certificates listed in the table above (`KEK`, CA and PCA which will allow us to build `db`, and `dbx`).
* Transfer the files to your master host.
  ```
  scp Mic*.crt dbxupdate_x64.bin root@ip_of_server:
  ```
* Build `db.auth`:
  * SSH to the server as root
  * convert the files from DER format to PEM:
    ```
    openssl x509 -in MicCorUEFCA2011_2011-06-27.crt -inform DER -outform PEM -out ms_ca.crt
    openssl x509 -in MicWinProPCA2011_2011-10-19.crt -inform DER -outform PEM -out ms_pca.crt
    ```
  * bundle these files into `db.auth`:
    ```
    /opt/xensource/libexec/create-auth db db.auth ms_ca.crt ms_pca.crt
    ```
* Install the certificates:
  ```
  secureboot-certs install default MicCorKEKCA2011_2011-06-24.crt db.auth dbxupdate_x64.bin
  ```

### Install Custom UEFI Certificates

:::tip
Advanced use, not needed by most users.
:::

`secureboot-certs` also supports installing your own custom certificates. The certs may be in the following formats:

* DER-encoded certificate
* PEM-encoded certificate
* An auth file (can be created with `/opt/xensource/libexec/create-auth`).

For example, to install a custom PK you may do the following:

```
# Enroll a custom PK along with the default KEK/db/dbx
secureboot-certs install PK.cer
```

The same procedure may be used to install custom KEK, db, or dbx variables.

To use multiple certificates in one variable (that is, have multiple certificates stored as a single KEK, db, or dbx), the certs must be packaged together into a .auth file, see [Use two or more certificates for a Secure Boot variable](#use-two-or-more-certificates-for-a-secure-boot-variable). Note that multiple certificates in the PK is not supported. If an auth file with multiple certs is loaded as the PK, only the first one found will be used.

Note that the virtual firmware, as is allowed by the specification, does not mandate that these default certificates be signed by their parent (i.e., the KEK doesn't need to be signed by PK) if they're installed via `secureboot-certs`. This verification *does* occur, however, when trying to enroll new certificates from inside the guest after boot. This is designed to give the host administrator full control over the certificates from the control domain.

You can also omit the dbx variable entirely.
This is the most compatible option for old installation media that may not include the newest Secure Boot fixes.
Once installed, the guest can still update the dbx variable on its own to revoke vulnerable bootloaders as long as the default KEK is included.
Omitting the dbx variable can be done using the following command:

```
# Install default PK/KEK/db variables, omit the dbx
secureboot-certs install default default default none
```

For help with the tool's install functionality, call `secureboot-certs install -h`.

### Resetting Pool UEFI Certificates (varstored >= 1.2.0-2.4)

If you want to revert to the XCP-ng pool Secure Boot defaults, simply issue the following command:

```
secureboot-certs clear
```

Existing VMs will not be affected.

## Enable Secure Boot for a Guest VM

### Enable Secure Boot at VM creation

First, [ensure your pool was setup for UEFI SecureBoot](#configure-the-pool).

During VM creation in Xen Orchestra, go to the *Advanced* section and select **uefi** as the **Boot firmware**. This will display a **Secure boot** toggle that can be clicked to enable Secure Boot.

![](../../assets/img/screenshots/xo_uefi_sb_create_option.png)

### Enable Secure Boot for an Existing UEFI VM

#### Prerequisite: make sure the VM is booting in UEFI mode
Warning: it is not recommended changing an existing VM's firmware type from BIOS to UEFI.

#### Enable Secure Boot for an Existing UEFI VM in Xen Orchestra

1. Shutdown the VM if it is not already shut down.

2. Go to the *Advanced* tab of the VM and click the **Secure boot** toggle
to enable Secure Boot.

![](../../assets/img/screenshots/xo_uefi_sb_post_install_option.png)

#### Enable Secure Boot for an Existing UEFI VM using `xe`

1. Shutdown the VM using the [shutdown](../appendix/cli_reference.md#vm-shutdown) command if it is not already shut down.

2. In the XCP-ng CLI, set the platform Secure Boot mode to `true`:

```
# Enable Secure Boot for the VM
xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm-uuid> platform:secureboot=true
```

#### Check Secure Boot Is Actually Enforced
Boot the VM, and [check Secure Boot is really enforced](#check-uefi-secure-boot-status-from-inside-the-vm). There are cases where you may think it is enforced but it isn't. See also [Troubleshoot Guest Secure Boot Issues](#troubleshoot-guest-secure-boot-issues).

:::tip
Any issues? Check [Troubleshoot Guest Secure Boot Issues](#troubleshoot-guest-secure-boot-issues).
:::

### Setup Secure Boot for Windows VMs

Windows VMs do not require extra installation packages because the Windows Loader and kernel are signed by the keys already installed by the `secureboot-certs` script. Enabling Secure Boot for the VM in XCP-ng enables Secure Boot in the VM UEFI firmware.

:::warning
If your VMs have any unsigned drivers, they will fail to load after enabling Secure Boot.
:::

:::warning Currently, only the PV drivers from Citrix work with Secure Boot.

Enabling Secure Boot on a Windows VM that has XCP-ng drivers will render the VM unbootable.

The key that signed XCP-ng drivers has expired and we are still in the process of getting a new one from Microsoft... Which is taking longer than expected (process started in August 2021).
:::

### Setup Secure Boot for Linux VMs

**In theory** (read why it's in theory in the *Boothole and fallouts* box below), the installers for mainstream Linux distributions (debian, RHEL, etc.) should install properly signed bootloaders and binaries, and should be installable in SB mode directly. Some other Linux distributions may require special packages for Secure Boot to function. Check that the distribution does support Secure Boot and follow the distribution's documentation to install any required Secure Boot software (e.g., shim) *before* enabling Secure Boot for the VM in XCP-ng.

:::warning
If the VM has any unsigned kernel modules, they will fail to load after enabling Secure Boot. Furthermore, the distribution will likely restrict other kernel features that are seen as loop holes in Secure Boot (kexec, /dev/mem, etc…). Please read the Secure Boot documentation from the distribution.
:::

:::tip Boothole and fallouts

2020 and 2021 have been complicated years for Secure Boot on Linux, due to major security flaws in `grub` ("Boothole" and its fallouts). Thus **all certificates that allowed Linux distributions to boot in SB mode have been revoked, twice**, and new ones have (or had) to be issued.

Consequences:
* Any installer that is not recent enough will fail to boot in Secure Boot mode if the most recent revocation list (`dbx`) is used (which is highly recommended if security is your objective).
* Distributions using the revoked certificates require updates before SB can be enabled (and possibly manual changes?).

Also see [VMs that won't boot due to a revoked certificate](#vms-that-wont-boot-due-to-a-revoked-certificate).

## Disable Secure Boot for a Guest VM

### Disable Secure Boot for a Guest VM using XO

Navigate to the *Advanced* tab and use the **Secure boot** toggle to disable Secure Boot. Reboot the VM and Secure Boot will be disabled.

### Disable Secure Boot for a Guest VM using `xe`

In the XCP-ng CLI:

```
# Disable Secure Boot for the VM
xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm-uuid> platform:secureboot=false
```

Reboot the VM and Secure Boot will be disabled.

## Troubleshoot Guest Secure Boot Issues
You may encounter the following issues with your VMs when enabling Secure Boot:
* The VM won't boot.
* The VM does boot, but SecureBoot is actually disabled.

Starting with XCP-ng 8.3, you can get a "secureboot readiness" status of a VM: from command line using `xe vm-get-secureboot-readiness uuid=<vm-uuid>`, or directly in Xen Orchestra's VM detail views. This table may also be of use for users of XCP-ng 8.2.1, but they will have to identify which situation they are in manually.

| Code | Label | Meaning or Symptoms | Solution |
|------|-------|---------------------|----------|
| disabled | SecureBoot not enforced | Secure Boot was not enabled by the user for this VM. | [Enable it](#enable-secure-boot-for-a-guest-vm) if you need to. |
| first_boot | SecureBoot enforced, pending first boot | Normal transient state. Secure Boot was enabled by the user but the VM hasn't booted yet so its certificates are still empty. | Boot the VM at least once so that the pool's UEFI certificates are propagated to it. |
| ready | SecureBoot enforced | From the hypervisor's point of view, all is ready for Secure Boot in the VM, and it's enforced. If the VM boots to a UEFI shell, this means that the boot binaries didn't pass the Secure Boot validation.| In case of boot failure, either the installed OS doesn't support Secure Boot, or its binaries were signed with a key which is not valid ([anymore?](#vms-that-wont-boot-due-to-a-revoked-certificate)) according to the UEFI certificates installed in the VM's UEFI variable store, or the installed certificates are wrong or inconsistent. |
| ready_no_dbx | SecureBoot enforced, but no dbx present | The minimum certificates necessary to enforce Secure Boot are present, but the revocation list is missing. This is not a good idea. See [Secure Boot and revoked certificates](#secure-boot-and-revoked-certificates).| We advise to install the `dbx` revocation list. |
| setup_mode | ⚠️ SecureBoot wanted, but disabled due to the VM being in UEFI setup mode | There is a mismatch between the user intent (enabling Secure Boot) and the state of the VM certificates (no PK, so the VM is in [Setup Mode](#uefi-setup-mode)). The VM boots, but Secure Boot is actually disabled! | [Check your pool was setup](#view-certificates-already-installed-on-the-pool) for Secure Boot, [set it up](#configure-the-pool) if needed, then [propagate the pool certificates to the VM](#propagate-pool-certificates-to-a-vm).|
| certs_incomplete | ⚠️ SecureBoot wanted, but some EFI certificates are missing | Unbootable VM because Secure Boot can't be enforced, due to missing certificates. Only some certs are present. This will often mean that your VM was booted before your pool was setup for Secure Boot, so it only has the `PK` key, and is missing the rest of the necessary certificates. | [Check your pool was setup](#view-certificates-already-installed-on-the-pool) for Secure Boot, [set it up](#configure-the-pool) if needed, then [propagate the pool certificates to the VM](#propagate-pool-certificates-to-a-vm).|


## Secure Boot and revoked certificates

### Revocation database updates

When there are security concerns related to some of the certificates involved in binary signing, they are revoked. That is, they are added to the `dbx` certificate revocation database.

On actual hardware, this `dbx` update would be propagated to you through a firmware update, or be coming from your OS itself. For example, Microsoft updates the `dbx` database of the computer as part of some of its security updates.

**We recommend that you use the default Secure Boot variables provided by XCP-ng**.
* These variables are automatically updated by varstored updates.
  * Any new VM will use the updated certificate databases the first time it starts.
  * Existing VMs won't be affected (unless they've never been booted after the first time you installed certificates to the pool).
* For existing VMs, either let them update the variables on their own (Windows does that), or [update manually](#change-the-certificates-already-installed-on-a-vm).

### VMs that won't boot due to a revoked certificate

Installed OSes and installation media that were previously perfectly bootable in Secure Boot mode may become unbootable after the certificate that signed their binaries is revoked.

This is what happened in 2021 to **the certificates used by all Linux distributions that support Secure Boot**, due to major security flaws in `grub` (this was fixed since).

You might encounter issues related to this in one of the following situations:
* You try to install a VM with an installation media whose binaries were signed by a key that has been revoked.
* You try to enable Secure Boot on an existing VM whose binaries were signed by a key that has been revoked.
* You manually updated the dbx on an existing (Linux) VM.

Despite this, we still recommend that you always install the latest revocation database (`dbx`) on your pools. Not doing so lowers the security of Secure Boot, as any malicious binary signed with a revoked certificate would pass Secure Boot checks.

***If you can't boot an installation media***:
* Check whether their exists an updated installer signed with a valid certificate. If yes, use it.
* Else go to "It still can't boot" below.

***If you can't boot an existing VM***:
* Disable Secure Boot, update the OS, follow any instructions from the OS provider related to the update of the signed binaries, power off, re-enable Secure Boot, try to boot.
* Else go to "It still can't boot" below.

***It still can't boot***:
  * either disable Secure Boot for the VM, as its binaries are not secure anymore anyway. This can be temporary until an update brings properly signed binaries.
  * or [install](#change-the-certificates-already-installed-on-a-vm) an older `dbx` to the VM, [downloaded from the archive of prior versions of `dbx` files](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile/archive). Let us stress again that this exposes the VM to risk, and therefore, we recommend that before choosing an archived `dbx` users evaluate the vulnerabilities that their guest system will be exposed to by omitting the most recent revocations. Above all, downgrading the `dbx` must not give you a dangerous false sense of security.

## Certificate Management

### View Certificates Already Installed on the Pool

To view the default certificates that are available pool-wide:

```
secureboot-certs report
```

If it lists `PK`, `KEK`, `db` and `dbx`, then your pool was already setup for Secure Boot.

### Change the Certificates Already Installed in a Pool

To change the certificates in a pool, simply call `secureboot-certs install` in the same ways as described in [Configure the Pool](#configure-the-pool).

The new certificates will be used for new VMs, but will *not* be automatically propagated to existing VMs. If you want an existing VM to use the new certificates, [explicitly propagate them to it](#change-the-certificates-already-installed-on-a-vm).

### Remove Certificates from the Pool

To remove the installed certs in the pool:

```
secureboot-certs clear
```

:::tip
Note that this does not remove the certs from the VMs. On XCP-ng 8.2.x it doesn't remove them from host disk either.
- On XCP-ng 8.2.x: to remove them from disk, remove the ".auth" files for the certs you'd like to remove, on every host (found in `/var/lib/uefistored/`).
- On XCP-ng 8.3 and later, host disk certificates will be removed by the clear command.
:::

### View Certificates Already Installed in a VM

List UEFI variables:

```
varstore-ls <vm-uuid>
```

And then to see the full cert:

```
varstore-get <vm-uuid> <guid> <name> | hexdump -Cv
```

The GUID and name for varstore-get are the values returned by `varstore-ls`.

### Change the Certificates Already Installed on a VM

A VM will usually have its own copy of the UEFI certificates (unless it never booted on a host that has certificates installed). To verify this, execute:

```
varstore-ls <vm-uuid>
```

If the relevant certs are installed, their names will be in the output (i.e., `PK`, `KEK`, `db`, or `dbx`).

#### Preparing for Secure Boot Variable Changes

:::warning
Changing existing Secure Boot certificates on a vTPM-enabled VM will invalidate its PCR7 measurements.
Any encryption keys bound to the TPM (e.g. disk encryption keys) will become inaccessible.
Make sure to take a backup of your disk encryption key (e.g. BitLocker recovery key) before making any changes to Secure Boot.
:::

If you're using BitLocker with a TPM-based key protector, use the following command to query the TPM binding state of your VM:

```
manage-bde -protectors -get C:
```

The following output shows an example of a Secure Boot-bound TPM configuration:

```
Volume C: []
All Key Protectors

    [...]
      ID: {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}
      PCR Validation Profile:
        7, 11
        (Uses Secure Boot for integrity validation)
```

Before changing Secure Boot keys, run this command to suspend BitLocker protection:

```
manage-bde -protectors -disable C: -rebootcount 1
```

:::tip
BitLocker protection will continue immediately at reboot.
You will need to follow the sequence: suspend BitLocker - **immediately shutdown** - update Secure Boot certificates - restart.
Alternatively, you may increase the `-rebootcount` value, update Secure Boot variables, then subsequently resume protection with the following command:
`manage-bde -protectors -enable C:`

If using `systemd-cryptenroll` or `clevis`, follow your distribution's user manual.

#### Propagate Pool Certificates to a VM

You may need to trigger the propagation of the pool's default UEFI certificates to a VM.

Possible reasons:
* The VM is in one of the situations described in [Troubleshoot Guest Secure Boot Issues](#troubleshoot-guest-secure-boot-issues).
* You want to update the VM certificates after you updated the pool certificates.

To trigger the propagation of the pool's default UEFI certificates to a VM:
* On XCP-ng 8.3 and above, Xen Orchestra offers a "Copy the pool's default UEFI certificates to the VM" button in the VM's *Advanced* view.
* Else, from the command line, you can run: `varstore-sb-state <vm-uuid> user`.

#### Update VM Certificates Manually

:::tip
Advanced use, not needed by most users.
:::

To update an individual certificate in the VM's NVRAM store:
* Create or download an X509 certificate, or a `.auth` certificate list file.
* If you are starting with an X509 certificate, use `/opt/xensource/libexec/create-auth` to convert it into a `.auth` file.
* Shutdown the VM
* Use varstore-set to load the .auth file into a VM. The attributes arg must be set to 0x27.
   ```
   varstore-set <vm-uuid> <guid> <name> 0x27 path/to/file.auth
   ```
   Where name is one of `PK`, `KEK`, `db` and `dbx`.
   The GUIDs for each variable are:
   ```
   8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c PK
   8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c KEK
   d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f db
   d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f dbx
   ```

## Misc

### Secure Boot and the UEFI Firmware Menu in the Guest

Disabling *and* enabling Secure Boot from the UEFI firmware menu inside the guest VM is explicitly disallowed on XCP-ng so as to ensure that guest users can not tamper with the Secure Boot policy set by the host administrator. This differs from enabling Secure Boot on physical hardware because that is typically done through the UEFI menu. On XCP-ng, instead, that privilege is given only to host administrators through the `uefistored` daemon and `varstored-tools` package.

Changes to the UEFI secure boot state in the UEFI menu will be ignored in favor of the host administrator's configuration. For example, deselecting **Attempt Secure Boot** will not disable Secure Boot on the next boot, although it would do so on a physical platform.

If disabling Secure Boot by removing keys via Custom Mode is attempted in the UEFI firmware menu, an error will display stating **Only Physical Presence User could delete NAME_OF_KEY in custom mode!** For example, if attempting to remove the **PK**:

### Check whether a VM runs on UEFI firmware from command line

```
xe vm-param-get uuid=<vm-uuid> param-name=HVM-boot-params param-key=firmware
```

### Check UEFI Secure Boot status from inside the VM

Enabling Secure Boot for a VM means that it will either boot an appropriately signed bootloader and OS kernel, or not boot at all if the Secure Boot checks didn't pass.

You may still want to verify, from inside a booted VM, whether Secure Boot was enforced or not.

On Linux VMs, you can either:
* run `dmesg -i secureboot`, which works on many distributions (not all) and should give you a line that looks like `secureboot: Secure boot enabled`
* or, if `mokutil` is installed, run `mokutil --sb-state`, which should output `SecureBoot enabled`
* or directly extract the information from the UEFI variables:
  ```
  # read the last byte of the SecureBoot variable and display it in hex format
  tail -c1 /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/SecureBoot-8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c | xxd -p
  ```
  The result should be either `01` (enabled) or `00` (disabled)

On Windows VMs, you can either:
* run `msinfo32` and check the value of `System Summary` / `Secure Boot State` (expected: `On`)
* or, from PowerShell as admin, run `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI` (expected: `True`)

### Use two or more certificates for a Secure Boot variable

:::tip
Advanced use, not needed by most users.
:::

To create a Secure Boot variable (PK, KEK, db, or dbx) with multiple certificates, it is required to use the `create-auth` tool to bundle the certificates into a single .auth file.

From command line, to create a KEK with certificates `cert1.crt` and `cert2.crt`:
```
/opt/xensource/libexec/create-auth KEK KEK.auth cert1.crt cert2.crt
```

To create the same auth as above, but also sign it with a custom key:
```
/opt/xensource/libexec/create-auth -c signer.crt -k signer.key KEK KEK.auth cert1.crt cert2.crt
```

After creating the auth file, use secureboot-certs to install it with the rest of your certs:

```
# Install custom KEK, download and install public PK/db/dbx certificates
secureboot-certs install default KEK.auth default latest
```

This may be done with any PK, KEK, db, or dbx.

### Remove Certificates from a VM

:::tip
Advanced use, not needed by most users.
:::

`PK`, `KEK`, `db` and `dbx` can be removed one by one with: `varstore-rm <vm-uuid> <guid> <name>`.

For example, to remove the `dbx` from a VM.

```
varstore-rm <vm-uuid> d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f dbx
```

Note that the GUID may be found by using `varstore-ls <vm-uuid>`.

:::tip
On XCP-ng 8.2.1, it's almost impossible to remove a VM's UEFI certificates, because any missing certificate will be automatically added back the next time the VM starts, if available among the pool certificates.
On XCP-ng 8.3 and above, removed certificates remain removed.
:::

### UEFI Setup Mode

:::tip
Advanced use, not needed by most users. Only works on XCP-ng 8.3 and above.
:::

A VM without a `PK` is in UEFI Setup Mode. In this mode, defined in the UEFI specifications, Secure Boot can't be enforced.

We don't know why someone would want to use Setup Mode in their VMs, but if for any reason you need it, you can switch a VM to Setup Mode with:

```
varstore-sb-state
```
