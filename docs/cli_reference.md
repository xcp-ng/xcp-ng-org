# xe CLI reference

The xe CLI can be used locally on any XCP-ng host, it's installed along with it. However, it's poolwide only. If you want a CLI or an API to control multiple pools at once, we strongly advise to use [Xen Orchestra CLI](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/architecture.html#xo-cli-cli).


## Getting help with xe commands

Basic help is available for CLI commands on-host by typing the following:

```
xe help
```

Help for individual commands is available by typing:

```
xe help <command>
```

For example:

```
[ ~]# xe help host-cpu-info
command name            : host-cpu-info
        reqd params     : 
        optional params : uuid
        description     : Lists information about the host's physical CPUs.
```

Or a list of all xe commands is displayed if you type:

```
xe help --all
```

## Basic xe syntax

The basic syntax of all XCP-ng xe CLI commands is:

```
xe <command> <argument>=value <argument>=value
```

Each specific command contains its own set of arguments that are of the form `argument=value`. Some commands have required arguments, and most have some set of optional arguments. Typically a command assumes default values for some of the optional arguments when invoked without them.

For example, adding a bootable ISO image as a mounted CD-Rom to a VM can be done with the following command:

```
xe vm-cd-add uuid=679c70cb-b358-00e1-72c0-819e8f74f00c cd-name=ubuntu-20.04.2-live-server-amd64.iso device=1
```

If the xe command is executed remotely, extra arguments are used to connect and authenticate. These arguments also take the form argument=argument_value.

The server argument is used to specify the host name or IP address. The username and password arguments are used to specify credentials.

A password-file argument can be specified instead of the password directly. In this case, the xe command attempts to read the password from the specified file and uses that password to connect. (Any trailing CRs and LFs at the end of the file are stripped off.) This method is more secure than specifying the password directly at the command line.

The optional port argument can be used to specify the agent port on the remote XCP-ng server (defaults to 443).

Example: On the local XCP-ng server:

```
xe vm-list
```

Example: On the remote XCP-ng server:

```
xe vm-list -user username -password password -server hostname
```

Shorthand syntax is also available for remote connection arguments:

* -u user name
* -pw password
* -pwf password file
* -p port
* -s server

Example: On a remote XCP-ng server:

```
xe vm-list -u myuser -pw mypassword -s hostname
```

Arguments are also taken from the environment variable `XE_EXTRA_ARGS`, in the form of comma-separated key/value pairs. For example, to enter commands that are run on a remote XCP-ng server, first run the following command:

```
export XE_EXTRA_ARGS="server=foobar,port=443,username=root,password=pass"
```

After running this command, you no longer have to specify the remote XCP-ng server parameters in each xe command that you run.

Using the `XE_EXTRA_ARGS` environment variable also enables tab completion of xe commands when issued against a remote XCP-ng server, which is disabled by default.

## Special characters and syntax

To specify argument/value pairs on the xe command line, write: `argument=value`

Unless the value includes spaces, do not use quotes. There should be no whitespace in between the argument name, the equals sign (=), and the value. Any argument not conforming to this format is ignored.

For values containing spaces, write: `argument="value with spaces"`

When you use the CLI on your XCP-ng server, commands have a tab completion feature similar to the feature in the standard Linux bash shell. For example, if you type `xe vm-l` and then press the `TAB` key, the rest of the command is displayed. If more than one command begins with `vm-l`, pressing `TAB` a second time lists the possibilities. This feature is useful when specifying object UUIDs in commands.

:::tip
Tab completion does not normally work when executing commands on a remote XCP-ng server. However, if you set the `XE_EXTRA_ARGS` variable on the machine where you enter the commands, tab completion is enabled. For more information, see Basic xe syntax.
:::

## Command types

The CLI commands can be split in two halves. Low-level commands are concerned with listing and parameter manipulation of API objects. Higher level commands are used to interact with VMs or hosts in a more abstract level.

The low-level commands are:

* class-list

* class-param-get

* class-param-set

* class-param-list

* class-param-add

* class-param-remove

* class-param-clear

Where class is one of:

* bond

* console

* host

* host-crashdump

* host-cpu

* network

* patch

* pbd

* pif

* pool

* sm

* sr

* task

* template

* vbd

* vdi

* vif

* vlan

* vm

Not every value of class has the full set of class-param-action commands. Some values of class have a smaller set of commands.

## Parameter types

The objects that are addressed with the xe commands have sets of parameters that identify them and define their states.

Most parameters take a single value. For example, the `name-label` parameter of a VM contains a single string value. In the output from parameter list commands, such as `xe vm-param-list`, a value in parentheses indicates whether parameters are read-write (RW) or read-only (RO). The output of `xe vm-param-list` on a specified VM might have the following lines:

```
user-version ( RW): 1
is-control-domain ( RO): false
```

The first parameter, user-version, is writable and has the value 1. The second, `is-control-domain`, is read-only and has a value of false.

The two other types of parameters are multi-valued. A set parameter contains a list of values. A map parameter is a set of key/value pairs. As an example, look at the following piece of sample output of the `xe vm-param-list` on a specified VM:

```
platform (MRW): acpi: true; apic: true; pae: true; nx: false
allowed-operations (SRO): pause; clean_shutdown; clean_reboot; \
hard_shutdown; hard_reboot; suspend
```

The platform parameter has a list of items that represent key/value pairs. The key names are followed by a colon character (`:`). Each key/value pair is separated from the next by a semicolon character (`;`). The `M` preceding the `RW` indicates that this parameter is a map parameter and is readable and writable. The allowed-operations parameter has a list that makes up a set of items. The `S` preceding the `RO` indicates that this is a set parameter and is readable but not writable.

To filter on a map parameter or set a map parameter, use a colon (`:`) to separate the map parameter name and the key/value pair. For example, to set the value of the `foo` key of the other-config parameter of a VM to `baa`, the command would be

```
xe vm-param-set uuid=VM uuid other-config:foo=baa
```

:::tip
In previous releases, the hyphen character (-) was used to specify map parameters. This syntax still works but is deprecated.
:::

## Low-level parameter commands

There are several commands for operating on parameters of objects: class-param-get, class-param-set, class-param-add, class-param-remove, class-param-clear, and class-param-list. Each of these commands takes a uuid parameter to specify the particular object. Since these commands are considered low-level commands, they must use the `UUID` and not the VM name label.

* `class-param-list uuid=uuid`

Lists all of the parameters and their associated values. Unlike the class-list command, this command lists the values of "expensive" fields.

* `class-param-get uuid=uuid param-name=parameter param-key=key`

Returns the value of a particular parameter. For a map parameter, specifying the param-key gets the value associated with that key in the map. If param-key is not specified or if the parameter is a set, the command returns a string representation of the set or map.

* `class-param-set uuid=uuid param=value`

Sets the value of one or more parameters.

* `class-param-add uuid=uuid param-name=parameter key=value param-key=key`

Adds to either a map or a set parameter. For a map parameter, add key/value pairs by using the key=value syntax. If the parameter is a set, add keys with the param-key=key syntax.

* `class-param-remove uuid=uuid param-name=parameter param-key=key`

Removes either a key/value pair from a map, or a key from a set.

* `class-param-clear uuid=uuid param-name=parameter`

Completely clears a set or a map.

## Low-level list commands

The class-list command lists the objects of type class. By default, this type of command lists all objects, printing a subset of the parameters. This behavior can be modified in the following ways:

* It can filter the objects so that it only outputs a subset
* The parameters that are printed can be modified.

To change the parameters that are printed, specify the argument params as a comma-separated list of the required parameters. For example:

```
xe vm-list params=name-label,other-config
```

Alternatively, to list all of the parameters, use the syntax:

```
xe vm-list params=all
```

The list command doesnâ€™t show some parameters that are expensive to calculate. These parameters are shown as, for example:

```
allowed-VBD-devices (SRO): <expensive field>
```

To obtain these fields, use either the command class-param-list or class-param-get

To filter the list, the CLI matches parameter values with those values specified on the command-line, only printing objects that match all of the specified constraints. For example:

```
xe vm-list HVM-boot-policy="BIOS order" power-state=halted
```

This command lists only those VMs for which both the field power-state has the value halted and the field `HVM-boot-policy` has the value BIOS order.

You can also filter the list by the value of keys in maps or by the existence of values in a set. The syntax for filtering based on keys in maps is `map-name:key=value`. The syntax for filtering based on values existing in a set is `set-name:contains=value`.

When scripting, a useful technique is passing `--minimal` on the command line, causing xe to print only the first field in a comma-separated list. For example, the command `xe vm-list --minimal` on a host with three VMs installed gives the three UUIDs of the VMs:

```
a85d6717-7264-d00e-069b-3b1d19d56ad9,aaa3eec5-9499-bcf3-4c03-af10baea96b7, 42c044de-df69-4b30-89d9-2c199564581d
```

## Secrets

XCP-ng provides a secrets mechanism to avoid passwords being stored in plaintext in command-line history or on API objects. XenCenter uses this feature automatically and it can also be used from the xe CLI for any command that requires a password.

:::tip
Password secrets cannot be used to authenticate with a XCP-ng host from a remote instance of the xe CLI.
:::

To create a secret object, run the following command on your XCP-ng host.

```
xe secret-create value=my-password
```

A secret is created and stored on the XCP-ng host. The command outputs the UUID of the secret object. For example, `99945d96-5890-de2a-3899-8c04ef2521db`. Append `_secret` to the name of the password argument to pass this UUID to any command that requires a password.

Example: On the XCP-ng host where you created the secret, you can run the following command:

```
xe sr-create device-config:location=sr_address device-config:type=cifs device-config:username=cifs_username device-config:cifspassword_secret=secret_uuid name-label="CIFS ISO SR" type="iso" content-type="iso" shared="true"
```

### Bonding commands

Commands for working with network bonds, for resilience with physical interface failover. For more information, see [Networking](networking.html#bonds).

The bond object is a reference object which glues together *master* and *member* PIFs. The master PIF is the bonding interface which must be used as the overall PIF to refer to the bond. The member PIFs are a set of two or more physical interfaces that have been combined into the high-level bonded interface.

```

List the CDs and ISOs (CD image files) on the XCP-ng server or pool, filtering on the optional argument `params`.

If the optional argument `params` is used, the value of params is a string containing a list of parameters of this object that you want to display. Alternatively, you can use the keyword `all` to show all parameters. When `params` is not used, the returned list shows a default subset of all available parameters.

Optional arguments can be any number of the [CD parameters](#cd-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

### Cluster commands

:::warning
Cluster doesn't work with XCP-ng, but only with Citrix Hypervisor Please do NOT use it!

```

Disables XAPI database replication to the specified SR.

##### Example usage

The example below shows the DR CLI commands in context:

On the primary site, enable database replication:

```
xe sr-database-replication uuid=sr=uuid
```

After a disaster, on the secondary site, connect to the SR. The `device-config` command has the same fields as `sr-probe`.

```
xe drtask-create type=lvmoiscsi device-config:target=target ip address device-config:targetIQN=target-iqn device-config:SCSIid=scsi-id sr-whitelist=sr-uuid
```

Look for database VDIs on the SR:

```
xe vdi-list sr-uuid=sr-uuid type=Metadata
```

Query a database VDI for VMs present:

```
xe vm-list database:vdi-uuid=vdi-uuid
```

Recover a VM:

```
xe vm-recover uuid=vm-uuid database:vdi-uuid=vdi-uuid
```

Destroy the DR task. Any SRs introduced by the DR task and not required by VMs are destroyed:

```
xe drtask-destroy uuid=drtask-uuid

### Event commands

Commands for working with events.

#### Event classes

Event classes are listed in the following table:

|Class name|Description|
|:---------|:----------|
|`pool`|A pool of physical hosts|
|`vm`|A Virtual Machine|
|`host`|A physical host|
|`network`|A virtual network|
|`vif`|A virtual network interface|
|`pif`|A physical network interface (separate VLANs are represented as several PIFs)|
|`sr`|A storage repository|
|`vdi`|A virtual disk image|
|`vbd`|A virtual block device|
|`pbd`|The physical block devices through which hosts access SRs|

#### `event-wait`

```
event-wait class=class_name [param-name=param_value] [param-name=/=param_value]
```

Blocks other commands from executing until an object exists that satisfies the conditions given on the command line. The argument `x=y` means "wait for field x to take value y" and `x=/=y` means "wait for field x to take any value other than y."

**Example:** wait for a specific VM to be running.

```
xe event-wait class=vm name-label=myvm power-state=running
```

Blocks other commands until a VM called `myvm` is in the `power-state` "running."

**Example:** wait for a specific VM to reboot:

```
xe event-wait class=vm uuid=$VM start-time=/=$(xe vm-list uuid=$VM params=start-time --minimal)
```

Blocks other commands until a VM with UUID *\$VM* reboots. The command uses the value of `start-time` to decide when the VM reboots.

The class name can be any of the [event classes](#event-classes) listed at the beginning of this section. The parameters can be any of the parameters listed in the CLI command *class*-param-list.

### GPU commands

### Virtual GPU operations

##### `vgpu-create`

```
vgpu-create vm-uuid=uuid_of_vm gpu_group_uuid=uuid_of_gpu_group [vgpu-type-uuid=uuid_of_vgpu-type]
```

Creates a virtual GPU. This command attaches the VM to the specified GPU group and optionally specifies the virtual GPU type. If no virtual GPU type is specified, the â€˜pass-throughâ€™ type is assumed.

##### `vgpu-destroy`

```
vgpu-destroy uuid=uuid_of_vgpu
```

Destroy the specified virtual GPU.

#### Disabling VNC for VMs with virtual GPU

```
xe vm-param-add uuid=uuid_of_vmparam-name=platform vgpu_vnc_enabled=true|false
```

Using `false` disables the VNC console for a VM as it passes `disablevnc=1` through to the display emulator. By default, VNC is enabled.

### Host commands

Commands for interacting with XCP-ng server.

XCP-ng servers are the physical servers running XCP-ng software. They have VMs running on them under the control of a special privileged Virtual Machine, known as the control domain or domain 0.

The XCP-ng server objects can be listed with the standard object listing commands: `xe host-list`, `xe host-cpu-list`, and `xe host-crashdump-list`). The parameters can be manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands).

#### Host selectors

Several of the commands listed here have a common mechanism for selecting one or more XCP-ng servers on which to perform the operation. The simplest is by supplying the argument `host=uuid_or_name_label`. You can also specify XCP-ng by filtering the full list of hosts on the values of fields. For example, specifying `enabled=true` selects all XCP-ng servers whose `enabled` field is equal to `true`. Where multiple XCP-ng servers match and the operation can be performed on multiple XCP-ng servers, you must specify `--multiple` to perform the operation. The full list of parameters that can be matched is described at the beginning of this section. You can obtain this list of commands by running the command `xe host-list params=all`. If no parameters to select XCP-ng servers are given, the operation is performed on all XCP-ng servers.

:::

#### `host-disable`

```
host-disable [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Disables the specified XCP-ng servers, which prevents any new VMs from starting on them. This action prepares the XCP-ng servers to be shut down or rebooted.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors)). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `host-emergency-management-reconfigure`

```
host-emergency-management-reconfigure interface=uuid_of_management_interface_pif
```

Reconfigure the management interface of this XCP-ng server. Use this command only if the XCP-ng server is in emergency mode. Emergency mode means that the host is a member in a resource pool whose master has disappeared from the network and cannot be contacted after a number of retries.

#### `host-enable`

```
host-enable [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Enables the specified XCP-ng servers, which allows new VMs to be started on them.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `host-enable-display`

```

If the evacuated host is the pool master, then another host must be selected to be the pool master. To change the pool master with HA disabled, use the `pool-designate-new-master` command. For more information, see [pool-designate-new-master](#pool-designate-new-master).

With HA enabled, your only option is to shut down the server, which causes HA to elect a new master at random. For more information, see [host-shutdown](#host-shutdown).

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `host-forget`

```
host-forget uuid=host_uuid
```

The XAPI agent forgets about the specified XCP-ng server without contacting it explicitly.

Use the `--force` parameter to avoid being prompted to confirm that you really want to perform this operation.

:::warning
Do not use this command if HA is enabled on the pool. Disable HA first, then enable it again after youâ€™ve forgotten the host.
:::

This command is useful if the XCP-ng server to "forget" is dead. However, if the XCP-ng server is live and part of the pool, use `xe pool-eject` instead.

#### `host-get-cpu-features`

```
host-get-cpu-features {features=pool_master_cpu_features} [uuid=host_uuid]
```

Prints a hexadecimal representation of the hostâ€™s physical-CPU features.

host-get-system-status filename=name_for_status_file [entries=comma_separated_list] [output=tar.bz2|zip] [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Download system status information into the specified file. The optional parameter `entries` is a comma-separated list of system status entries, taken from the capabilities XML fragment returned by the `host-get-system-status-capabilities` command. For more information, see [host-get-system-status-capabilities](#host-get-system-status-capabilities). If not specified, all system status information is saved in the file. The parameter `output` may be *tar.bz2* (the default) or *zip*. If this parameter is not specified, the file is saved in `tar.bz2` form.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above).

#### `host-get-system-status-capabilities`

```
host-get-system-status-capabilities [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Get system status capabilities for the specified hosts. The capabilities are returned as an XML fragment that similar to the following example:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<system-status-capabilities>
    <capability content-type="text/plain" default-checked="yes" key="xenserver-logs"  \
        max-size="150425200" max-time="-1" min-size="150425200" min-time="-1" \
        pii="maybe"/>
    <capability content-type="text/plain" default-checked="yes" \
        key="xenserver-install" max-size="51200" max-time="-1" min-size="10240" \
        min-time="-1" pii="maybe"/>
    ...
</system-status-capabilities>
```

Each capability entity can have the following attributes.

- `key` A unique identifier for the capability.
- `content-type` Can be either text/plain or application/data. Indicates whether a UI can render the entries for human consumption.
- `default-checked` Can be either yes or no. Indicates whether a UI should select this entry by default.
- `min-size`, `max-size` Indicates an approximate range for the size, in bytes, of this entry. -1 indicates that the size is unimportant.
- `min-time`, `max-time` Indicate an approximate range for the time, in seconds, taken to collect this entry. -1 indicates that the time is unimportant.
- `pii` Personally identifiable information. Indicates whether the entry has information that can identify the system owner or details of their network topology. The attribute can have one of the following values:
  - `no`: no PII is in these entries
  - `yes`: PII likely or certainly is in these entries
  - `maybe`: you might want to audit these entries for PII
  - `if_customized` if the files are unmodified, then they contain no PII. However, because we encourage editing of these files, PII might have been introduced by such customization. This value is used in particular for the networking scripts in the control domain.
  Passwords are never to be included in any bug report, regardless of any PII declaration.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above).

#### `host-get-thread-diagnostics`

```
host-get-thread-diagnostics uuid=uuid
```

Display per-host thread diagnostic information.

#### `host-get-vms-which-prevent-evacuation`

```

Displays the contents of the XCP-ng server license.

#### `host-logs-download`

```
host-logs-download [file-name=logfile_name] [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Download a copy of the logs of the specified XCP-ng servers. The copy is saved by default in a time-stamped file named `hostname-yyyy-mm-dd T hh:mm:ssZ.tar.gz`. You can specify a different file name using the optional parameter *file-name*.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

:::warning
While the `xe host-logs-download` command works if executed on the local host (that is, without a specific host name specified), do *not* use it this way. Doing so clutters the control domain partition with the copy of the logs. The command should *only* be used from a remote off-host machine where you have space to hold the copy of the logs.
:::

#### `host-management-disable`

```
host-management-disable
```

Disables the host agent listening on an external management network interface and disconnects all connected API clients (such as the XenCenter). This command operates directly on the XCP-ng server the CLI is connected to. The command is not forwarded to the pool master when applied to a member XCP-ng server.

:::warning
Be careful when using this CLI command off-host. After this command is run, you cannot connect to the control domain remotely over the network to re-enable the host agent.
:::

#### `host-management-reconfigure`

```
host-management-reconfigure [interface=device] [pif-uuid=uuid]
```

Reconfigures the XCP-ng server to use the specified network interface as its management interface, which is the interface that is used to connect to the XenCenter. The command rewrites the MANAGEMENT\_INTERFACE key in `/etc/xensource-inventory`.

If the device name of an interface (which must have an IP address) is specified, the XCP-ng server immediately rebinds. This command works both in normal and emergency mode.

If the UUID of a PIF object is specified, the XCP-ng server determines which IP address to rebind to itself. It must not be in emergency mode when this command is executed.

:::warning
Be careful when using this CLI command off-host and ensure that you have network connectivity on the new interface. Use `xe pif-reconfigure` to set one up first. Otherwise, subsequent CLI commands are unable to reach the XCP-ng server.
:::

#### `host-power-on`

```
host-power-on [host=host_uuid]
```

Turns on power on XCP-ng servers with the *Host Power On* function enabled. Before using this command, enable `host-set-power-on` on the host.

#### `host-reboot`

```
host-reboot [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Reboot the specified XCP-ng servers. The specified hosts must be disabled first using the `xe host-disable` command, otherwise a `HOST_IN_USE` error message is displayed.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

If the specified XCP-ng servers are members of a pool, the loss of connectivity on shutdown is handled and the pool recovers when the XCP-ng servers returns. The other members and the master continue to function.

If you shut down the master, the pool is out of action until one of the following actions occurs:

- You make one of the members into the master
- The original master is rebooted and back on line.

When the master is back online, the members reconnect and synchronize with the master.

#### `host-restore`

```
host-restore [file-name=backup_filename] [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Restore a backup named `file-name` of the XCP-ng server control software. The use of the word "restore" here does not mean a full restore in the usual sense, it merely means that the compressed backup file has been uncompressed and unpacked onto the secondary partition. After youâ€™ve done a `xe host-restore`, you have to boot the Install CD and use its Restore from Backup option.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `host-send-debug-keys`

```
host-send-debug-keys  host-uuid=host_uuid keys=keys
```

Send specified hypervisor debug keys to specified host.

#### `host-set-hostname-live`

```
host-set-hostname-live host-uuid=uuid_of_host host-name=new_hostname
```

Change the host name of the XCP-ng server specified by `host-uuid`. This command persistently sets both the host name in the control domain database and the actual Linux host name of the XCP-ng server. The value of `host-name` is *not* the same as the value of the `name_label` field.

#### `host-set-power-on-mode`

```
host-set-power-on-mode host=host_uuid power-on-mode={"" | "wake-on-lan" | "iLO" | "DRAC" | "custom"} [ power-on-config:power_on_ip=ip-address power-on-config:power_on_user=user power-on-config:power_on_password_secret=secret-uuid ]
```

Use to enable the *Host Power On* function on XCP-ng hosts that are compatible with remote power solutions. When using the `host-set-power-on` command, you must specify the type of power management solution on the host (that is, the power-on-mode). Then specify configuration options using the power-on-config argument and its associated key-value pairs.

To use the secrets feature to store your password, specify the key `"power_on_password_secret"`. For more information, see [Secrets](#secrets).

#### `host-shutdown`

```
host-shutdown [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Shut down the specified XCP-ng servers. The specified XCP-ng servers must be disabled first using the `xe host-disable` command, otherwise a `HOST_IN_USE` error message is displayed.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

If the specified XCP-ng servers are members of a pool, the loss of connectivity on shutdown is handled and the pool recovers when the XCP-ng servers returns. The other members and the master continue to function.

If you shut down the master, the pool is out of action until one of the following actions occurs:

- You make one of the members into the master
- The original master is rebooted and back on line.

When the master is back online, the members reconnect and synchronize with the master.

If HA is enabled for the pool, one of the members is made into a master automatically. If HA is disabled, you must manually designate the desired server as master with the `pool-designate-new-master` command. For more information, see [pool-designate-new-master](#pool-designate-new-master).

#### `host-sm-dp-destroy`

```
host-sm-dp-destroy uuid=uuid dp=dp [allow-leak=true|false]
```

Attempt to destroy and clean up a storage datapath on a host. If `allow-leak=true` is provided then it deletes all records of the datapath even if it is not shut down cleanly.

#### `host-sync-data`

```
host-sync-data
```

Synchronize the non-database data stored on the pool master with the named host.

#### `host-syslog-reconfigure`

```
host-syslog-reconfigure [host-selector=host_selector_value...]
```

Reconfigure the `syslog` daemon on the specified XCP-ng servers. This command applies the configuration information defined in the host `logging` parameter.

The hosts on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors) above). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `host-data-source-list`

```
host-data-source-list [host-selectors=host selector value...]
```

List the data sources that can be recorded for a host.

Select the hosts on which to perform this operation by using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors)). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section. If no parameters to select hosts are given, the operation is performed on all hosts.

Data sources have two parameters â€“ `standard` and `enabled`. This command outputs the values of the parameters:

- If a data source has `enabled` set to `true`, the metrics are currently being recorded to the performance database.
- If a data source has `standard` set to `true`, the metrics are recorded to the performance database *by default*. The value of `enabled` is also set to `true` for this data source.
- If a data source has `standard` set to `false`, the metrics are *not* recorded to the performance database by default. The value of `enabled` is also set to `false` for this data source.

To start recording data source metrics to the performance database, run the `host-data-source-record` command. This command sets `enabled` to `true`. To stop, run the `host-data-source-forget`. This command sets `enabled` to `false`.

#### `host-data-source-record`

```

This operation writes the information from the data source to the persistent performance metrics database of the specified hosts. For performance reasons, this database is distinct from the normal agent database.

Select the hosts on which to perform this operation by using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors)). Optional arguments can be any number of the [host parameters](#host-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section. If no parameters to select hosts are given, the operation is performed on all hosts.

#### `host-data-source-forget`

```
host-data-source-forget data-source=name_description_of_data_source [host-selectors=host_selector_value...]
```

Stop recording the specified data source for a host and forget all of the recorded data.

Select the hosts on which to perform this operation by using the standard selection mechanism (see [host selectors](#host-selectors)).

### Pool commands

Commands for working with pools. A *pool* is an aggregate of one or more XCP-ng servers. A pool uses one or more shared storage repositories so that the VMs running on one host in the pool can be migrated in near-real time to another host in the pool. This migration happens while the VM is still running, without it needing to be shut down and brought back up. Each XCP-ng server is really a pool consisting of a single member by default. When your XCP-ng server is joined to a pool, it is designated as a member, and the pool it has joined becomes the master for the pool.

The singleton pool object can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe pool-list`). Its parameters can be manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

Reconfigures the management interface of all the hosts in the pool to use the specified network interface, which is the interface that is used to connect to the XenCenter. The command rewrites the MANAGEMENT\_INTERFACE key in `/etc/xensource-inventory` for all the hosts in the pool.

If the device name of an interface (which must have an IP address) is specified, the XCP-ng master host immediately rebinds. This command works both in normal and emergency mode.

From the network UUID specified, UUID of the PIF object is identified and mapped to the XCP-ng server, which determines which IP address to rebind to itself. It must not be in emergency mode when this command is executed.

:::warning
Be careful when using this CLI command off-host and ensure that you have network connectivity on the new interface. Use `xe pif-reconfigure` to set one up first. Otherwise, subsequent CLI commands are unable to reach the XCP-ng server.
:::
#### `pool-recover-slaves`

```
pool-recover-slaves
```

Instruct the pool master to try to reset the master address of all members currently running in emergency mode. This command is typically used after `pool-emergency-transition-to-master` has been used to set one of the members as the new master.

#### `pool-restore-database`

```
pool-restore-database file-name=filename_to_restore_from_on_client [dry-run=true|false]
```

Upload a database backup (created with `pool-dump-database`) to a pool. On receiving the upload, the master restarts itself with the new database.

There is also a *dry run* option, which allows you to check that the pool database can be restored without actually perform the operation. By default, `dry-run` is set to false.

#### `pool-retrieve-wlb-configuration`

```
pool-retrieve-wlb-configuration
```

Retrieves the pool optimization criteria from the Workload Balancing server.

#### `pool-retrieve-wlb-diagnostics`

```

Retrieves diagnostics from the Workload Balancing server.

#### `pool-retrieve-wlb-recommendations`

```
pool-retrieve-wlb-recommendations
```

Retrieves VM migrate recommendations for the pool from the Workload Balancing server.

```

Sets the pool optimization criteria for the Workload Balancing server.

#### `pool-sync-database`

```
pool-sync-database
```

Force the pool database to be synchronized across all hosts in the resource pool. This command is not necessary in normal operation since the database is regularly automatically replicated. However, the command can be useful for ensuring changes are rapidly replicated after performing a significant set of CLI operations.

### Set pool `igmp-snooping`

#### `snapshot-clone`

```
snapshot-clone new-name-label=name_label [uuid=uuid] [new-name-description=description]
```

Create a new template by cloning an existing snapshot, using storage-level fast disk clone operation where available.

#### `snapshot-copy`

```
snapshot-copy new-name-label=name_label [uuid=uuid] [new-name-description=name_description] [sr-uuid=sr_uuid]
```

Create a new template by copying an existing VM, but without using storage-level fast disk clone operation (even if this is available). The disk images of the copied VM are guaranteed to be â€˜full imagesâ€™ - i.e. not part of a CoW chain.

#### `snapshot-destroy`

```
snapshot-destroy  [uuid=uuid] [snapshot-uuid=snapshot_uuid]
```

Destroy a snapshot. This leaves the storage associated with the snapshot intact. To delete storage too, use snapshot-uninstall.

```

Force the VM power state to halted in the management toolstack database only. This command is used to recover a snapshot that is marked as â€˜suspendedâ€™. This is a potentially dangerous operation: you must ensure that you do not need the memory image anymore. You will not be able to resume your snapshot anymore.

#### `snapshot-revert`

```
snapshot-revert [uuid=uuid] [snapshot-uuid=snapshot_uuid]
```

Revert an existing VM to a previous checkpointed or snapshot state.

#### `snapshot-uninstall`

```
snapshot-uninstall [uuid=uuid] [snapshot-uuid=snapshot_uuid] [--force]
```

Uninstall a snapshot. This operation will destroy those VDIs that are marked RW and connected to this snapshot only. To simply destroy the VM record, use snapshot-destroy.

```

Creates an SR on the disk, introduces it into the database, and creates a PBD attaching the SR to the XCP-ng server. If `shared` is set to `true`, a PBD is created for each XCP-ng server in the pool. If `shared` is not specified or set to `false`, a PBD is created only for the XCP-ng server specified with `host-uuid`.

The exact `device-config` parameters differ depending on the device `type`. For details of these parameters across the different storage back-ends, see [Storage](./storage.md).

#### `sr-data-source-forget`

```
sr-data-source-forget data-source=data_source
```

Stop recording the specified data source for a SR, and forget all of the recorded data.

#### `sr-introduce`

```
sr-introduce name-label=name physical-size=physical_size type=type content-type=content_type uuid=sr_uuid
```

Just places an SR record into the database. Use `device-config` to specify additional parameters in the form `device-config:parameter_key=parameter_value`, for example:

```
xe sr-introduce device-config:device=/dev/sdb1
```

:::tip
This command is never used in normal operation. This advanced operation might be useful when an SR must be reconfigured as shared after it was created or to help recover from various failure scenarios.
:::

#### `sr-probe`

```
sr-probe type=type [host-uuid=host_uuid] [device-config:config_name=value]
```

Performs a backend-specific scan, using the provided `device-config` keys. If the `device-config` is complete for the SR back-end, this command returns a list of the SRs present on the device, if any. If the `device-config` parameters are only partial, a back-end-specific scan is performed, returning results that guide you in improving the remaining `device-config` parameters. The scan results are returned as backend-specific XML, printed on the CLI.

The exact `device-config` parameters differ depending on the device `type`. For details of these parameters across the different storage back-ends, see [Storage](./storage.md).

#### `sr-probe-ext`

```
sr-probe-ext type=type [host-uuid=host_uuid] [device-config:=config] [sm-config:-sm_config]
```

Perform a storage probe. The device-config parameters can be specified by for example device-config:devs=/dev/sdb1. Unlike sr-probe, this command returns results in the same human-readable format for every SR type.

#### `sr-scan`

```
sr-scan uuid=sr_uuid
```

Force an SR scan, syncing the XAPI database with VDIs present in the underlying storage substrate.

#### `sr-update`

### Task commands

Commands for working with long-running asynchronous tasks. These commands are tasks such as starting, stopping, and suspending a virtual machine. The tasks are typically made up of a set of other atomic subtasks that together accomplish the requested operation.

The task objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe task-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

#### Task parameters

|Parameter Name|Description|Type|
|:-------------|:----------|:---|
|`uuid`|The unique identifier/object reference for the Task|Read only|
|`name-label`|The name of the Task|Read only|
|`name-description`|The description string of the Task|Read only|

|`progress`|If the Task is still pending, this field contains the estimated percentage complete, from 0 to 1. If the Task has completed, successfully or unsuccessfully, the value is 1.|Read only|
|`type`|If the Task has successfully completed, this parameter contains the type of the encoded result. The type is the name of the class whose reference is in the result field. Otherwise, this parameterâ€™s value is undefined|Read only|
|`result`|If the Task has completed successfully, this field contains the result value, either Void or an object reference; otherwise, this parameterâ€™s value is undefined|Read only|
|`error_info`|If the Task has failed, this parameter contains the set of associated error strings. Otherwise, this parameterâ€™s value is undefined|Read only|
|`allowed_operations`|List of the operations allowed in this state|Read only|

|`subtasks`|Contains the UUIDs of all the subtasks of this task|Read only|

#### `task-cancel`

```
task-cancel [uuid=task_uuid]
```

Direct the specified Task to cancel and return.

### Template commands

Commands for working with VM templates.

Templates are essentially VMs with the `is-a-template` parameter set to `true`. A template is a "gold image" that contains all the various configuration settings to instantiate a specific VM. XCP-ng ships with a base set of templates, which are generic "raw" VMs that can boot an OS vendor installation CD (for example: RHEL, CentOS, SLES, Windows). You can create VMs, configure them in standard forms for your particular needs, and save a copy of them as templates for future use in VM deployment.

The template objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe template-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

:::tip
Templates cannot be directly converted into VMs by setting the `is-a-template` parameter to `false`. Setting `is-a-template` parameter to `false` is not supported and results in a VM that cannot be started.
:::

#### VM template parameters

Templates have the following parameters:

-   `uuid` (read only) the unique identifier/object reference for the template
-   `name-label` (read/write) the name of the template
-   `name-description` (read/write) the description string of the template
-   `user-version` (read/write) string for creators of VMs and templates to put version information
-   `is-a-template` (read/write) true if this VM is a template. Template VMs can never be started, they are used only for cloning other VMs. After this value has been set to true, it cannot be reset to false. Template VMs cannot be converted into VMs using this parameter.
-   `is-control-domain` (read only) true if this is a control domain (domain 0 or a driver domain)
-   `power-state` (read only) current power state. The value is always halted for a template
-   `memory-dynamic-max` (read only) dynamic maximum memory in bytes. Currently unused, but if changed the following constraint must be obeyed: `memory_static_max` `>=` `memory_dynamic_max` `>=` `memory_dynamic_min` `>=` `memory_static_min`.
-   `memory-dynamic-min` (read/write) dynamic minimum memory in bytes. Currently unused, but if changed the same constraints for `memory-dynamic-max` must be obeyed.
-   `memory-static-max` (read/write) statically set (absolute) maximum memory in bytes. This field is the main value used to determine the amount of memory assigned to a VM.
-   `memory-static-min` (read/write) statically set (absolute) minimum memory in bytes. This field represents the absolute minimum memory, and `memory-static-min` must be less than `memory-static-max`. This value is unused in normal operation, but the previous constraint must be obeyed.
-   `suspend-VDI-uuid` (read only) the VDI that a suspend image is stored on (has no meaning for a template)
-   `VCPUs-params` (read/write map parameter) configuration parameters for the selected vCPU policy.

You can tune a vCPUâ€™s pinning with:

```
xe template-param-set uuid=<template_uuid> vCPUs-params:mask=1,2,3
```

A VM created from this template run on physical CPUs 1, 2, and 3 only.
You can also tune the vCPU priority (xen scheduling) with the cap and weight parameters. For example:

```
xe template-param-set uuid=<template_uuid> VCPUs-params:weight=512 xe template-param-set uuid=<template_uuid> VCPUs-params:cap=100
```

A VM based on this template with a weight of 512 get twice as much CPU as a domain with a weight of 256 on a contended host. Legal weights range from 1 to 65535 and the default is 256.

The cap optionally fixes the maximum amount of CPU a VM based on this template can consume, even if the XCP-ng server has idle CPU cycles. The cap is expressed in percentage of one physical CPU: 100 is 1 physical CPU, 50 is half a CPU, 400 is 4 CPUs, and so on The default, 0, means that there is no upper cap.

- `VCPUs-max` (read/write) maximum number of vCPUs
- `VCPUs-at-startup` (read/write) boot number of vCPUs
- `actions-after-crash` (read/write) action to take when a VM based on this template crashes

```
xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm_uuid> platform:hvm_serial=none
```

### Update commands

:::warning
Update mechanism in XCP-ng is using `yum`, not this CLI. Please do NOT use it and check the [updates section](updates.md).
:::

The update objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe update-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

### VBD commands

Commands for working with VBDs (Virtual Block Devices).

A VBD is a software object that connects a VM to the VDI, which represents the contents of the virtual disk. The VBD has the attributes which tie the VDI to the VM (is it bootable, its read/write metrics, and so on). The VDI has the information on the physical attributes of the virtual disk (which type of SR, whether the disk is sharable, whether the media is read/write or read only, and so on).

The VBD objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe vbd-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

#### VBD parameters

VBDs have the following parameters:

|Parameter Name|Description|Type|
|:-------------|:----------|:---|

```

Create a VBD on a VM.

The allowable values for the `device` field are integers 0â€“15, and the number must be unique for each VM. The current allowable values can be seen in the `allowed-VBD-devices` parameter on the specified VM. This is seen as `userdevice` in the `vbd` parameters.

If the `type` is `Disk`, `vdi-uuid` is required. Mode can be `RO` or `RW` for a Disk.

If the `type` is `CD`, `vdi-uuid` is optional. If no VDI is specified, an empty VBD is created for the CD. Mode must be `RO` for a CD.

#### `vbd-destroy`

```

Attempts to detach the VBD from the VM while it is in the running state.

### VDI commands

Commands for working with VDIs (Virtual Disk Images).

A VDI is a software object that represents the contents of the virtual disk seen by a VM. This is different to the VBD, which is an object that ties a VM to the VDI. The VDI has the information on the physical attributes of the virtual disk (which type of SR, whether the disk is sharable, whether the media is read/write or read only, and so on). The VBD has the attributes that tie the VDI to the VM (is it bootable, its read/write metrics, and so on).

The VDI objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe vdi-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

#### `vdi-clone`

```
vdi-clone uuid=uuid_of_the_vdi [driver-params:key=value]
```

Create a new, writable copy of the specified VDI that can be used directly. It is a variant of `vdi-copy` that is can expose high-speed image clone facilities where they exist.

Use the optional `driver-params` map parameter to pass extra vendor-specific configuration information to the back-end storage driver that the VDI is based on. For more information, see the storage vendor driver documentation.

#### `vdi-copy`

```
vdi-copy uuid=uuid_of_the_vdi sr-uuid=uuid_of_the_destination_sr
```

Copy a VDI to a specified SR.

#### `vdi-create`

```
vdi-create sr-uuid=uuid_of_sr_to_create_vdi_on name-label=name_for_the_vdi type=system|user|suspend|crashdump virtual-size=size_of_virtual_disk sm-config-\*=storage_specific_configuration_data
```

Create a VDI.

The `virtual-size` parameter can be specified in bytes or using the IEC standard suffixes KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB.

:::tip
SR types that support thin provisioning of disks (such as Local VHD and NFS) do not enforce virtual allocation of disks. Take great care when over-allocating virtual disk space on an SR. If an over-allocated SR becomes full, disk space must be made available either on the SR target substrate or by deleting unused VDIs in the SR.
Some SR types might round up the `virtual-size` value to make it divisible by a configured block size.
:::

#### `vdi-data-destroy`

```
vdi-data-destroy uuid=uuid_of_vdi
```

Destroy the data associated with the specified VDI, but keep the changed block tracking metadata.

:::tip
If you use changed block tracking to take incremental backups of the VDI, ensure that you use the `vdi-data-destroy` command to delete snapshots but keep the metadata. Do not use `vdi-destroy` on snapshots of VDIs that have changed block tracking enabled.
:::

#### `vdi-destroy`

```
vdi-destroy uuid=uuid_of_vdi
```

Destroy the specified VDI.

:::tip
If you use changed block tracking to take incremental backups of the VDI, ensure that you use the `vdi-data-destroy` command to delete snapshots but keep the metadata. Do not use `vdi-destroy` on snapshots of VDIs that have changed block tracking enabled.
For Local VHD and NFS SR types, disk space is not immediately released on `vdi-destroy`, but periodically during a storage repository scan operation. If you must force deleted disk space to be made available, call [`sr-scan`](#sr-scan) manually.
:::

#### `vdi-disable-cbt`

```
vdi-disable-cbt uuid=uuid_of_vdi
```

Disable changed block tracking for the VDI.

#### `vdi-enable-cbt`

```
vdi-enable-cbt uuid=uuid_of_vdi
```

Enable changed block tracking for the VDI.

:::tip
You can enable changed block tracking only on licensed instances of XCP-ng Premium Edition.
:::

#### `vdi-export`

```
vdi-export uuid=uuid_of_vdi filename=filename_to_export_to [format=format] [base=uuid_of_base_vdi] [--progress]
```

Export a VDI to the specified file name. You can export a VDI in one of the following formats:

- `raw`
- `vhd`

The VHD format can be *sparse*. If there are unallocated blocks within the VDI, these blocks might be omitted from the VHD file, therefore making the VHD file smaller. You can export to VHD format from all supported VHD-based storage types (EXT, NFS).

If you specify the `base` parameter, this command exports only those blocks that have changed between the exported VDI and the base VDI.

#### `vdi-forget`

```
vdi-forget uuid=uuid_of_vdi
```

Unconditionally removes a VDI record from the database without touching the storage back-end. In normal operation, you should be using [`vdi-destroy`](#vdi-destroy) instead.

#### `vdi-import`

```
vdi-import uuid=uuid_of_vdi filename=filename_to_import_from [format=format] [--progress]
```

Import a VDI. You can import a VDI from one of the following formats:

- `raw`
- `vhd`

#### `vdi-introduce`

```
vdi-introduce uuid=uuid_of_vdi sr-uuid=uuid_of_sr name-label=name_of_new_vdi type=system|user|suspend|crashdump location=device_location_(varies_by_storage_type) [name-description=description_of_vdi] [sharable=yes|no] [read-only=yes|no] [other-config=map_to_store_misc_user_specific_data] [xenstore-data=map_to_of_additional_xenstore_keys] [sm-config=storage_specific_configuration_data]
```

Create a VDI object representing an existing storage device, without actually modifying or creating any storage. This command is primarily used internally to introduce hot-plugged storage devices automatically.

#### `vdi-list-changed-blocks`

```
vdi-list-changed-blocks vdi-from-uuid=first-vdi-uuid vdi-to-uuid=second-vdi-uuid
```

Compare two VDIs and return the list of blocks that have changed between the two as a base64-encoded string. This command works only for VDIs that have changed block tracking enabled.

#### `vdi-pool-migrate`

```
vdi-pool-migrate uuid=VDI_uuid sr-uuid=destination-sr-uuid
```

Migrate a VDI to a specified SR, while the VDI is attached to a running guest. (Storage live migration)

#### `vdi-resize`

```
vdi-resize uuid=vdi_uuid disk-size=new_size_for_disk
```

Change the size of the VDI specified by UUID.

#### `vdi-snapshot`

```
vdi-snapshot uuid=uuid_of_the_vdi [driver-params=params]
```

Produces a read-write version of a VDI that can be used as a reference for backup or template creation purposes or both. Use the snapshot to perform a backup rather than installing and running backup software inside the VM. The VM continues running while external backup software streams the contents of the snapshot to the backup media. Similarly, a snapshot can be used as a "gold image" on which to base a template. A template can be made using any VDIs.

Use the optional `driver-params` map parameter to pass extra vendor-specific configuration information to the back-end storage driver that the VDI is based on. For more information, see the storage vendor driver documentation.

A clone of a snapshot should always produce a writable VDI.

#### `vdi-unlock`

```
vdi-unlock uuid=uuid_of_vdi_to_unlock [force=true]
```

Attempts to unlock the specified VDIs. If `force=true` is passed to the command, it forces the unlocking operation.

#### `vdi-update`

```
vdi-update uuid=uuid
```

Refresh the fields of the VDI object in the database.

### VIF commands

Commands for working with VIFs (Virtual network interfaces).

The VIF objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe vif-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

### VIF parameters

VIFs have the following parameters:

- `uuid` (read only) the unique identifier/object reference for the VIF
- `vm-uuid` (read only) the unique identifier/object reference for the VM that this VIF resides on
- `vm-name-label` (read only) the name of the VM that this VIF resides on

- `MAC` (read only) MAC address of VIF, as exposed to the VM
- `MTU` (read only) Maximum Transmission Unit of the VIF in bytes.

This parameter is read-only, but you can override the MTU setting with the `mtu` key using the `other-config` map parameter. For example, to reset the MTU on a virtual NIC to use jumbo frames:

```
xe vif-param-set uuid=<vif_uuid> other-config:mtu=9000
```

- `currently-attached` (read only) true if the device is attached
- `qos_algorithm_type` (read/write) QoS algorithm to use

- `io_write_kbs` (read only) average write rate in kB/s for this VIF
- `locking_mode` (read/write) Affects the VIFs ability to filter traffic to/from a list of MAC and IP addresses. Requires extra parameters.
- `locking_mode:default` (read/write) Varies according to the default locking mode for the VIF network.

If the default-locking-mode is set to `disabled`, XCP-ng applies a filtering rule so that the VIF cannot send or receive traffic. If the default-locking-mode is set to `unlocked`, XCP-ng removes all the filtering rules associated with the VIF. For more information, see [Network Commands](#network-commands).

- `locking_mode:locked` (read/write) Only traffic sent to or sent from the specified MAC and IP addresses is allowed on the VIF. If no IP addresses are specified, no traffic is allowed.
- `locking_mode:unlocked` (read/write) No filters are applied to any traffic going to or from the VIF.
- `locking_mode:disabled` (read/write) XCP-ng applies a filtering rule is applied so that the VIF drops all traffic.

#### `vif-create`

```
vif-create vm-uuid=uuid_of_the_vm device=see below network-uuid=uuid_of_network_to_connect_to [mac=mac_address]
```

Create a VIF on a VM.

Appropriate values for the `device` field are listed in the parameter `allowed-VIF-devices` on the specified VM. Before any VIFs exist there, the values allowed are integers from 0-15.

The `mac` parameter is the standard MAC address in the form `aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff`. If you leave it unspecified, an appropriate random MAC address is created. You can also explicitly set a random MAC address by specifying `mac=random`.

#### `vif-destroy`

```
vif-destroy uuid=uuid_of_vif
```

Destroy a VIF.

#### `vif-move`

```
vif-move uuid=uuid network-uuid=network_uuid

```

Clean IPv6 settings as below:

```
vif-configure-ipv6 uuid=uuid_of_vif mode=none
```

### VLAN commands

Commands for working with VLANs (virtual networks). To list and edit virtual interfaces, refer to the PIF commands, which have a VLAN parameter to signal that they have an associated virtual network. For more information, see [PIF commands](#pif-commands). For example, to list VLANs, use `xe pif-list`.

#### `vlan-create`

```
vlan-create pif-uuid=uuid_of_pif vlan=vlan_number network-uuid=uuid_of_network
```

Create a VLAN on your XCP-ng server.

#### `pool-vlan-create`

```
pool-vlan-create pif-uuid=uuid_of_pif vlan=vlan_number network-uuid=uuid_of_network
```

#### `vlan-destroy`

```
vlan-destroy uuid=uuid_of_pif_mapped_to_vlan
```

Destroy a VLAN. Requires the UUID of the PIF that represents the VLAN.

### VM commands

Commands for controlling VMs and their attributes.

#### VM selectors

Several of the commands listed here have a common mechanism for selecting one or more VMs on which to perform the operation. The simplest way is by supplying the argument `vm=name_or_uuid`. An easy way to get the uuid of an actual VM is to, for example, execute `xe vm-list power-state=running`. (Get the full list of fields that can be matched by using the command `xe vm-list params=all`. ) For example, specifying `power-state=halted` selects VMs whose `power-state` parameter is equal to `halted`. Where multiple VMs are matching, specify the option `--multiple` to perform the operation. The full list of parameters that can be matched is described at the beginning of this section.

The VM objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe vm-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

#### VM parameters

VMs have the following parameters:

:::tip
All writable VM parameter values can be changed while the VM is running, but new parameters are *not* applied dynamically and cannot be applied until the VM is rebooted.
:::

- `appliance` (read/write) the appliance/vApp to which the VM belongs
- `uuid` (read only) the unique identifier/object reference for the VM
- `name-label` (read/write) the name of the VM
- `name-description` (read/write) the description string of the VM
- `order start order` (read/write) for vApp startup/shutdown and for startup after HA failover
- `version` (read only) the number of times this VM has been recovered. If you want to overwrite a new VM with an older version, call `vm-recover`
- `user-version` (read/write) string for creators of VMs and templates to put version information
- `is-a-template` (read/write) False unless this VM is a template. Template VMs can never be started, they are used only for cloning other VMs After this value has been set to true it cannot be reset to false. Template VMs cannot be converted into VMs using this parameter.
- `is-control-domain` (read only) True if this is a control domain (domain 0 or a driver domain)
- `power-state` (read only) current power state
- `start-delay` (read/write) the delay to wait before a call to start up the VM returns
- `shutdown-delay` (read/write) the delay to wait before a call to shut down the VM returns
- `memory-dynamic-max` (read/write) dynamic maximum in bytes
- `memory-dynamic-min` (read/write) dynamic minimum in bytes
- `memory-static-max` (read/write) statically set (absolute) maximum in bytes. If you want to change this value, the VM must be shut down.
- `memory-static-min` (read/write) statically set (absolute) minimum in bytes. If you want to change this value, the VM must be shut down.
- `suspend-VDI-uuid` (read only) the VDI that a suspend image is stored on
- `VCPUs-params` (read/write map parameter) configuration parameters for the selected vCPU policy.

You can tune a vCPUâ€™s pinning with

```
xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm_uuid> VCPUs-params:mask=1,2,3
```

The selected VM then runs on physical CPUs 1, 2, and 3 only. You can also tune the vCPU priority (xen scheduling) with the cap and weight parameters. For example:

```
xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm_uuid> VCPUs-params:weight=512 xe vm-param-set uuid=<vm_uuid> VCPUs-params:cap=100
```

A VM with a weight of 512 get twice as much CPU as a domain with a weight of 256 on a contended XCP-ng server. Legal weights range from 1 to 65535 and the default is 256. The cap optionally fixes the maximum amount of CPU a VM will be able to consume, even if the XCP-ng server has idle CPU cycles. The cap is expressed in percentage of one physical CPU: 100 is 1 physical CPU, 50 is half a CPU, 400 is 4 CPUs, and so on The default, 0, means that there is no upper cap.

- `VCPUs-max` (read/write) maximum number of virtual CPUs.
- `VCPUs-at-startup` (read/write) boot number of virtual CPUs
- `actions-after-crash` (read/write) action to take if the VM crashes. For PV guests, valid parameters are:
  - `preserve` (for analysis only)
  - `coredump_and_restart` (record a coredump and reboot VM)
  - `coredump_and_destroy` (record a coredump and leave VM halted)

Alternatively, you can use the keyword `all` to show all parameters. If `params` is not used, the returned list shows a default subset of all available parameters.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-data-source-list`

```
vm-data-source-list [vm-selector=vm selector value...]
```

List the data sources that can be recorded for a VM.

Select the VMs on which to perform this operation by using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section. If no parameters to select hosts are given, the operation is performed on all VMs.

Data sources have two parameters â€“ `standard` and `enabled` â€“ which you can seen in the output of this command. If a data source has `enabled` set to `true`, the metrics are currently being recorded to the performance database. If a data source has `standard` set to `true`, the metrics are recorded to the performance database by default (and `enabled` is also set to `true` for this data source). If a data source has `standard` set to `false`, the metrics are *not* recorded to the performance database by default (and `enabled` is also set to `false` for this data source).

To start recording data source metrics to the performance database, run the `vm-data-source-record` command. This command sets `enabled` to `true`. To stop, run the `vm-data-source-forget`. This command sets `enabled` to `false`.

#### `vm-data-source-record`

```
vm-data-source-record data-source=name_description_of_data-source [vm-selector=vm selector value...]
```

Select the VMs on which to perform this operation by using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section. If no parameters to select hosts are given, the operation is performed on all VMs.

#### `vm-destroy`

```
vm-destroy uuid=uuid_of_vm
```

Destroy the specified VM. This leaves the storage associated with the VM intact. To delete storage as well, use `xe vm-uninstall`.

#### `vm-disk-add`

```
vm-disk-add disk-size=size_of_disk_to_add device=uuid_of_device [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

Add a disk to the specified VMs. Select the `device` parameter from the value of the `allowed-VBD-devices` parameter of the VMs.

The `disk-size` parameter can be specified in bytes or using the IEC standard suffixes KiB, MiB, GiB, and TiB.

#### `vm-disk-list`

```
vm-disk-list [vbd-params] [vdi-params] [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

Lists disks attached to the specified VMs. The `vbd-params` and `vdi-params` parameters control the fields of the respective objects to output. Give the parameters as a comma-separated list, or the special key `all` for the complete list.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-disk-remove`

```
vm-disk-remove device=integer_label_of_disk [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-export`

```
vm-export filename=export_filename [metadata=true|false] [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

Export the specified VMs (including disk images) to a file on the local machine. Specify the file name to export the VM into using the `filename` parameter. By convention, the file name should have a `.xva` extension.

If the `metadata` parameter is `true`, the disks are not exported. Only the VM metadata is written to the output file. Use this parameter when the underlying storage is transferred through other mechanisms, and permits the VM information to be recreated. For more information, see [vm-import](#vm-import).

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-import`

```
vm-import filename=export_filename [metadata=true|false] [preserve=true|false][sr-uuid=destination_sr_uuid]
```

Import a VM from a previously exported file. If `preserve` is set to `true`, the MAC address of the original VM is preserved. The `sr-uuid` determines the destination SR to import the VM into. If this parameter is not specified, the default SR is used.

If the `metadata` is `true`, you can import a previously exported set of metadata without their associated disk blocks. Metadata-only import fails if any VDIs cannot be found (named by SR and `VDI.location`) unless the `--force` option is specified, in which case the import proceeds regardless. If disks can be mirrored or moved out-of-band, metadata import/export is a fast way of moving VMs between disjoint pools. For example, as part of a disaster recovery plan.

:::tip
Multiple VM imports are performed faster in serial that in parallel.
:::

#### `vm-install`

```
vm-install new-name-label=name [template-uuid=uuid_of_desired_template] [template=template_uuid_or_name] [sr-uuid=sr_uuid | sr-name-label=name_of_sr][copy-bios-strings-from=host_uuid]
```

Install or clone a VM from a template. Specify the template name using either the `template-uuid` or `template` argument. Specify an SR using either the `sr-uuid` or `sr-name-label` argument. Specify to install BIOS-locked media using the `copy-bios-strings-from` argument.

:::tip
When installing from a template that has existing disks, by default, new disks are created in the same SR as these existing disks. Where the SR supports it, these disks are fast copies. If a different SR is specified on the command line, the new disks are created there. In this case, a fast copy is not possible and the disks are full copies.
When installing from a template that doesnâ€™t have existing disks, any new disks are created in the SR specified, or the pool default SR when an SR is not specified.
:::

#### `vm-is-bios-customized`

```
vm-is-bios-customized
```

Indicates whether the BIOS strings of the VM have been customized.

#### `vm-memory-balloon`

```
vm-memory-balloon target=target
```

Set the memory target for a running VM. The given value must be within the range defined by the VMâ€™s memory\_dynamic\_min and memory\_dynamic\_max values.

#### `vm-memory-dynamic-range-set`

```
vm-memory-dynamic-range-set min=min max=max
```

Configure the dynamic memory range of a VM. The dynamic memory range defines soft lower and upper limits for a VMâ€™s memory. Itâ€™s possible to change these fields when a VM is running or halted. The dynamic range must fit within the static range.

#### `vm-memory-limits-set`

```
vm-memory-limits-set static-min=static_min static-max=static_max dynamic-min=dynamic_min dynamic-max=dynamic_max
```

Configure the memory limits of a VM.

#### `vm-memory-set`

```
vm-memory-set memory=memory
```

Configure the memory allocation of a VM.

#### `vm-memory-shadow-multiplier-set`

```
vm-memory-shadow-multiplier-set [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...] [multiplier=float_memory_multiplier]
```

Set the shadow memory multiplier for the specified VM.

This is an advanced option which modifies the amount of *shadow memory* assigned to a hardware-assisted VM.

In some specialized application workloads, such as Citrix Virtual Apps, extra shadow memory is required to achieve full performance.

This memory is considered to be an overhead. It is separated from the normal memory calculations for accounting memory to a VM. When this command is invoked, the amount of free host memory decreases according to the multiplier and the `HVM_shadow_multiplier` field is updated with the value that Xen has assigned to the VM. If there is not enough XCP-ng server memory free, an error is returned.

The VMs on which this operation should be performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors).

#### `vm-memory-static-range-set`

```
vm-memory-static-range-set min=min max=max
```

Configure the static memory range of a VM. The static memory range defines hard lower and upper limits for a VMâ€™s memory. Itâ€™s possible to change these fields only when a VM is halted. The static range must encompass the dynamic range.

#### `vm-memory-target-set`

```
vm-memory-target-set target=target
```

Set the memory target for a halted or running VM. The given value must be within the range defined by the VMâ€™s memory\_static\_min and memory\_static\_max values.

#### `vm-memory-target-wait`

```
vm-memory-target-wait
```

Wait for a running VM to reach its current memory target.

#### `vm-migrate`

```
vm-migrate [copy=true|false] [host-uuid=destination_host_uuid] [host=name_or_ uuid_of_destination_host] [force=true|false] [live=true|false] [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...] [remote-master=destination_pool_master_uuid] [remote-username=destination_pool_username] [remote-password=destination_pool_password] [remote-network=destination_pool_network_uuid ][vif:=vif_uuid] [vdi=vdi_uuid]
```

This command migrates the specified VMs between physical hosts. The `host` parameter can be either the name or the UUID of the XCP-ng server. For example, to migrate the VM to another host in the pool, where the VM disks are on storage shared by both hosts:

```
xe vm-migrate uuid=vm_uuid host-uuid=host_uuid
```

To move VMs between hosts in the same pool, which do not share storage (storage live migration):

```
xe vm-migrate uuid=vm_uuid remote-master=12.34.56.78 remote-username=username remote-password=password host-uuid=desination_host_uuid vdi=vdi_uuid
```

You can choose the SR where each VDI gets stored:

```
xe vm-migrate uuid=vm_uuid host-uuid=destination_host_uuid vdi1:vdi_1_uuid=destination_sr_uuid vdi2:vdi_2_uuid=destination_sr2_uuid vdi3:vdi_3_uuid=destination_sr3_uuid
```

Additionally, you can choose which network to attach the VM after migration:

```
xe vm-migrate uuid=vm_uuid vdi1:vdi_1_uuid=destination_sr_uuid vdi2:vdi_2_uuid=destination_sr2_uuid vdi3:vdi_3_uuid=destination_sr3_uuid vif:vif_uuid=network_uuid
```

For cross-pool migration:

```
xe vm-migrate uuid=vm_uuid remote-master=12.34.56.78 remote-username=username remote-password=password host-uuid=desination_host_uuid vdi=vdi_uuid
```

By default, the VM is suspended, migrated, and resumed on the other host. The `live` parameter selects live migration. Live migration keeps the VM running while performing the migration, thus minimizing VM downtime to less than a second. In some circumstances, such as extremely memory-heavy workloads in the VM, live migration falls back into default mode and suspends the VM for a short time before completing the memory transfer.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

```

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

This is an *advanced* command only to be used when a member host in a pool goes down. You can use this command to force the pool master to reset the power-state of the VMs to be `halted`. Essentially, this command forces the lock on the VM and its disks so it can be started next on another pool host. This call *requires* the force flag to be specified, and fails if it is not on the command-line.

```

Suspend the specified VM.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-uninstall`

```
vm-uninstall [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...] [force=true|false]
```

Uninstall a VM, destroying its disks (those VDIs that are marked RW and connected to this VM only) in addition to its metadata record. To destroy just the VM metadata, use `xe vm-destroy`.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

#### `vm-unpause`

```
vm-unpause
```

Unpause a paused VM.

#### `vm-vcpu-hotplug`

```
vm-vcpu-hotplug new-vcpus=new_vcpu_count [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

Dynamically adjust the number of vCPUs available to a running Linux VM. The number of vCPUs is bounded by the parameter `VCPUs-max`. Windows VMs always run with the number of vCPUs set to `VCPUs-max` and must be rebooted to change this value.

The Linux VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

:::tip
When running Linux VMs without XCP-ng VM Tools installed, run the following command on the VM as `root` to ensure the newly hot plugged vCPUs are used: `# for i in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[1-9]*/online; do if [ "$(cat $i)" = 0 ]; then echo 1 > $i; fi; done`
:::

#### `vm-vif-list`

```
vm-vif-list [vm-selector=vm_selector_value...]
```

Lists the VIFs from the specified VMs.

The VM or VMs on which this operation is performed are selected using the standard selection mechanism. For more information, see [VM selectors](#vm-selectors). The selectors operate on the VM records when filtering, and *not* on the VIF values. Optional arguments can be any number of the [VM parameters](#vm-parameters) listed at the beginning of this section.

### Scheduled snapshots

:::warning
We advise to use Xen Orchestra instead of this method. See [Xen Orchestra rolling snapshots](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/rolling_snapshots.html).
:::

Commands for controlling VM scheduled snapshots and their attributes.

The vmss objects can be listed with the standard object listing command (`xe vmss-list`), and the parameters manipulated with the standard parameter commands. For more information, see [Low-level parameter commands](#low-level-parameter-commands)

#### `vmss-create`

```
vmss-create enabled=True/False name-label=name type=type frequency=frequency retained-snapshots=value name-description=description schedule:schedule
```

Creates a snapshot schedule in the pool.

For example:

```
xe vmss-create retained-snapshots=9 enabled=true frequency=daily name-description=sample name-label=samplepolicy type=snapshot schedule:hour=10 schedule:min=30
```

Snapshot schedules have the following parameters:

|Parameter Name|Description|Type|
|:-------------|:----------|:---|
|`name-label`|Name of the snapshot schedule.|Read/write|
|`name-description`|Description of the snapshot schedule.|Read/write|
|`type`|Disk snapshot or memory snapshot.|Read/write|
|`frequency`|Hourly; Daily; Weekly|Read/write|
|`retained-snapshots`|Snapshots to be retained. Range: 1-10.|Read/write|
|`schedule`|`schedule:days` (Monday to Sunday), `schedule:hours` (0 to 23), `schedule:minutes` (0, 15, 30, 45)|Read/write|

#### `vmss-destroy`

```
vmss-destroy uuid=uuid
```

Destroys a snapshot schedule in the pool.

### USB passthrough

### USB passthrough enable/disable

```
pusb-param-set uuid=pusb_uuid passthrough-enabled=true/false
```

Enable/disable USB Pass-through.

#### `pusb-scan`

```
pusb-scan host-uuid=host_uuid
```

Scan PUSB and update.

#### `vusb-create`

```
vusb-create usb-group-uuid=usb_group_uuid vm-uuid=vm_uuid
```

Creates a virtual USB in the pool. Start the VM to pass through the USB to the VM.

#### `vusb-unplug`

```
vusb-unplug uuid=vusb_uuid
```

Unplugs USB from VM.

#### `vusb-destroy`

```
vusb-destroy uuid=vusb_uuid
```

Removes the virtual USB list from VM.
