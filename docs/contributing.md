## Test

It's important to test XCP-ng on many different platforms and devices. You have gear laying around or access to some special devices? -> be a tester and test all the features of XCP-ng ðŸš€

Your results are very welcome in our [Hardware Compatibility List (HCL)](hardware.md)!

It's also important to test Operating Systems on XCP-ng. You have fun to install different Operating Systems? -> great! Test them all on XCP-ng!

Most community testing is organized on the forum, on dedicated threads.
* Watch the [thread dedicated to update candidates on stable releases](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/topic/365/updates-announcements-and-testing) (and make sure you enable mail notifications in your forum settings).
* Check beta and RC announcements for new releases of XCP-ng [on the forum](https://xcp-ng.org/forum), and provide feedback before the final releases. Usually announced in the [News](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/11/news) section.
* Check other topics created by our developers who look for feedback about new features. Topics usually created in the [Development](https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/7/development) section.

You can also read [this](develprocess.md#tests) for test ideas.

## Develop

You are a developer and want to code with us? Cool!

There are many components, in various languages: C, ocaml, python and more.

* Connect with us via
    * IRC: #xcp-ng and #xcp-ng-dev on irc.freenode.net
    * Forum -> Development Corner: <https://xcp-ng.org/forum/category/7/development>
* Read [this introduction](develprocess.md#development). The rest of the [Development Process Tour](develprocess.md) is also of interest for anyone who wants to help on development.

## Package

Development is one thing, but for your changes to reach actual users, they need to be packaged into RPMs.

See the [Development Process Tour](develprocess.md) for an introduction about the packaging process, and useful tips (like: [how to rebuild a RPM for XCP-ng locally](develprocess.md#local-rpm-build)).

## Talk about us

Another valuable way to help is by talking about XCP-ng to people you know or to your audience.
