# Install XCP-ng

How to install XCP-ng.

## üíø ISO installation

If you want to use the netinstall ISO, see the [Netinstall section](#-netinstall).

### Download and create media

You can download the latest installer for XCP-ng 8.3 LTS from here: [https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.3/xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606.iso?https=1](https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.3/xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606.iso?https=1).

SHA256 checksums, GPG signatures and net-install ISOs are available [here](https://xcp-ng.org/#easy-to-install).

Then, create the install media (e.g. a USB key 1GB or larger should work):

```
# example with XCP-ng 8.3
dd if=xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M oflag=direct
```

Finally, boot on that media and go to the next section.

:::tip
On Windows, you can use Rufus to create the bootable USB stick.
:::

### Start the host

Start the host and boot on the USB media.

### Follow instructions

#### 1. UEFI vs BIOS

Boot screens are just slightly different on start between BIOS and UEFI mode:

BIOS splash screen:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install1bis.png)

UEFI splash screen:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install1.png)

:::warning
NEVER switch from UEFI to BIOS (or vice-versa) **after** you installed XCP-ng. Stick to the mode that you chose during the install.
:::

#### 2. Language selection

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install2.png)

#### 3. Welcome

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install3.png)

#### 4. EULA/license

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install4.png)


#### 5. Disk selection

<a name="_5-disk-selection"></a>
This is the screen where you'll select where XCP-ng system will be installed. **XCP-ng is a specialized Linux distribution**, so you need to dedicate a physical disk to it. Partitioning is done automatically.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install5.png)

Alternatively, if you have two identical disks, you can use Software RAID (`mdadm`) :

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install6.png)

:::tip
If only one disk is found suitable for the installation, this step is skipped. The name of the device will be displayed to you [in the "Confirm Installation" step, later in the process](#12-installation).
:::

#### 6. VM storage selection

This is the place where your VM disks will be stored. It's called a **Storage Repository** (SR). It can use the same disk you installed the system on. It will automatically use the free space after system partitions.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install7.png)


:::tip
EXT instead of LVM? We advise to use EXT to benefit from thin provisioning!
:::

:::warning
When the installer skips [step 5](#5-disk-selection) automatically, users sometimes mistake this step with the selection of the system disk.
:::

#### 7. Installation source

If you use the default ISO, just select "Local media":

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install9.png)

Then, you can verify your media or not:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install10.png)

#### 8. Host password

This will be the **root** password, used to connect to the host with SSH and XAPI.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install11.png)

#### 9. Networking

Here you can select between DHCP and static network, even using a VLAN:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install12.png)

#### 10. Hostname and DNS

Configure the hostname of your server and the DNS resolvers.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install13.png)

#### 11. Timezone and time

:::warning
ALWAYS use a NTP server. It's a critical component to manage your host(s). If you don't know any NTP server, you can use `pool.ntp.org`.
:::

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install14.png)

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install15.png)

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install16.png)

#### 12. Installation

:::warning
After this step, data will be written on the disk(s)! Check the listed device(s) one last time.
:::

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install17.png)

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install19.png)

#### 13. Supplemental packs and end of install

Not relevant in almost all cases. Skip it:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install20.png)

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install21.png)

:::tip
"Completing installation" is in fact installing the bootloader and building the initramfs. It can take time.
:::

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install22.png)

#### 14. Reboot

After a reboot, you should see the GRUB menu:

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install23.png)

It means the system is correctly installed! Enjoy XCP-ng üöÄ

## üåê Netinstall

The netinstall image is a lightweight ISO (around 150MiB) that will only contain the installer, but no actual RPM packages. Sometimes, it's more convenient/faster when your ISO is on a slow connection (e.g. a virtual media using a server IPMI).

You can download it on this URL: [https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.3/xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606-netinstall.iso?https=1](https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.3/xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606-netinstall.iso?https=1).

As with the regular installation ISO, write it on a USB media:

```
dd if=xcp-ng-8.3.0-20250606-netinstall.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M oflag=direct
```

Everything else is like the [regular install](#start-the-host), except that it will not offer to install from local media, only from distant ones.

## üé¨ PXE boot install

### Requirements

To get XCP-ng installed from PXE, you need:

* DHCP and TFTP configured servers
* Any NFS, FTP or HTTP server (your choice) to host XCP-ng installation files
* A PXE-boot compatible network card on your host

:::tip
PXE boot doesn't support tagged VLAN networks! Be sure to boot on a untagged network!
:::

### TFTP server configuration

#### TFTP server configuration - BIOS boot

1. In your TFTP root directory (eg `/tftp`), create a folder named `xcp-ng`.
2. Copy the `mboot.c32` and `pxelinux.0` files from the installation media to the TFTP root directory.
3. From the XCP-ng installation media, copy the files `install.img` (from the root directory), `vmlinuz`, and `xen.gz` (from the /boot directory) to the new `xcp-ng` directory on the TFTP server.
4. In the TFTP root directory, create a folder called `pxelinux.cfg`
5. In the pxelinux.cfg directory, create your configuration file called `default`.

The file itself will contain the way to install XCP-ng: manually (with answer to provide on the host console/screen) or fully automated (see [Automated install](/installation/install-xcp-ng/#-automated-install) below).

Here is an example of a manual installation:

```
default xcp-ng
label xcp-ng
    kernel mboot.c32
    append xcp-ng/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=2 dom0_mem=2048M,max:2048M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- xcp-ng/vmlinuz xencons=hvc console=hvc0 console=tty0 --- xcp-ng/install.img
```

How TFTP folder looks like when configured
```
tree -L 1 /srv/tftp/
srv/tftp
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mboot.c32
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pxelinux.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pxelinux.cfg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ default
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xcp-ng
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.img
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vmlinuz
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xen.gz
```

#### TFTP server configuration - UEFI boot

If you want to make an installation in UEFI mode, you need to have a slightly different TFTP server configuration:

1. In your TFTP root folder, create a directory called `EFI/xcp-ng`
2. Configure your DHCP server to provide `/EFI/xcp-ng/grubx64.efi` as the boot file
3. Create a `grub.cfg` as follow:
```
 menuentry "XCP-ng Install (serial)" {
    multiboot2 /EFI/xcp-ng/xen.gz dom0_mem=2048M,max:2048M watchdog \
    dom0_max_vcpus=4 com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
    module2 /EFI/xcp-ng/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 install
    module2 /EFI/xcp-ng/install.img
 }
```
4. Copy this `grub.cfg` file to `EFI/xenserver` folder on the TFTP server
5. Get the following files from XCP-ng ISO: `grubx64.efi`, `install.img` (from the root directory), `vmlinuz`, and `xen.gz` (from the /boot directory) to the new `EFI/xcp-ng` directory on the TFTP server.

How TFTP folder looks like when configured
```
tree -L 1 /srv/tftp/
srv/tftp
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EFI
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xcp-ng
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ grubx64.efi
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install.img
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vmlinuz
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xen.gz
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xenserver
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ grub.cfg
```

On the FTP, NFS or HTTP server, get all the installation media content in there.

For layout example check the [official repository](https://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/netinstall/latest).

:::tip
When you do copy the installation files, **DO NOT FORGET** the `.treeinfo` file. Double check your webserver isn't blocking it (like Microsoft IIS does).
:::

#### On the host

1. Start your host
2. Enter the boot menu (usually F12)
3. Select boot from the Ethernet card
4. You should see the PXE menu you created before!

## ‚ú® iPXE over HTTP install

This guide is for UEFI boot, using iPXE over an HTTP server to serve files needed for installation.

### Requirements

To get XCP-ng installed from iPXE over HTTP, you need:

* An HTTP server to host XCP-ng installation files
* A iPXE compatible network card and iPXE firmware on your host

1. In your HTTP root directory copy the contents of the net install ISO.

The top-level should look like this:

```
tree -L 1 /path/to/http-directory/
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EFI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EULA
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSES
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RPM-GPG-KEY-CH-8
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RPM-GPG-KEY-CH-8-LCM
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RPM-GPG-KEY-Platform-V1
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ install.img
```

2. Boot the target machine.
3. Press Ctrl-B to catch the iPXE menu.  Use the chainload command to load grub.

```
chain http://SERVER_IP/EFI/xenserver/grubx64.efi
```

:::tip
Sometimes grub takes a very long time to load after displaying "Welcome to Grub".  This can be fixed by compiling a new version of Grub with `grub-mkstandalone`.
:::

4. Once the grub prompt loads, set the root to http and load the config file.

```
# Replace with your server's ip
set root=(http,SERVER_IP)
configfile /EFI/xenserver/grub.cfg
```

5. Select the "install" menu entry.
6. Wait for grub to load the necessary binaries.  This may take a minute.  If you look at your http server log you should see something like:

```
# (from python3 -m http.server path-to-directory 80)

192.168.0.10 - - [11/Mar/2021 03:25:58] "GET /boot/xen.gz HTTP/1.1" 200 -
192.168.0.10 - - [11/Mar/2021 03:25:58] "GET /boot/vmlinuz HTTP/1.1" 200 -
192.168.0.10 - - [11/Mar/2021 03:26:03] "GET /install.img HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```
7. Continue with installation as normal.


## ü§ñ Automated install
<a name="-automatedinstall"></a>
XCP-ng's installation can be automated by using network boot (PXE) or a custom installation image.

### Answerfile

Unattended installation requires what is called an answer file, often spelled *answerfile*.

It is an XML file that contains the answers to questions the installer would ask during a manual installation.

Here's an example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
    <installation srtype="ext">
        <primary-disk>sda</primary-disk>
        <guest-disk>sdb</guest-disk>
        <guest-disk>sdc</guest-disk>
        <keymap>us</keymap>
        <root-password>mypassword</root-password>
        <source type="url">http://pxehost.example.com/xcp-ng/</source>
        <post-install-script type="url">
            http://pxehost.example.com/myscripts/post-install-script
        </post-install-script>
        <admin-interface name="eth0" proto="dhcp" />
        <timezone>Europe/Paris</timezone>
    </installation>
```

:::tip
Check [the full answerfile reference](../../appendix/answerfile).
:::

### Via PXE

Follow the [previous section on Network boot (PXE)](#-pxe-boot-install) and add options to that will fetch and use an answer file.

#### PXE unattended install - BIOS boot

Add `answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to `vmlinuz` (the linux kernel of the installer).

Example:
```
default xcp-ng-auto
label xcp-ng-auto
    kernel mboot.c32
    append xcp-ng/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=2 dom0_mem=2048M,max:2048M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- xcp-ng/vmlinuz xencons=hvc console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install --- xcp-ng/install.img
```

:::tip
Any SYSLINUX configuration style file will be valid. [Find more on the syslinux website](https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=PXELINUX).
:::

#### PXE unattended install - UEFI boot

Add `answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to `vmlinuz` (the linux kernel of the installer).

Example:
```
menuentry "XCP-ng Install (serial)" {
    multiboot2 /EFI/xcp-ng/xen.gz dom0_mem=2048M,max:2048M watchdog dom0_max_vcpus=4 com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
    module2 /EFI/xcp-ng/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile_device=eth0 answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install
    module2 /EFI/xcp-ng/install.img
}
```

### Unattended installation with a custom ISO image

You may build a custom installation image that will automatically install XCP-ng. The answerfile can either be downloaded by the installer or embedded in the image itself.

#### Unattended installation ISO with remote config

If you can't or don't want to setup PXE but can still serve a file (the answerfile) from a server that will be available to the hosts during installation, you can create an automated installation image that will fetch its configuration from the network.

1. [Prepare an answerfile](../../appendix/answerfile) and make it available from a local HTTP server
2. [Extract the XCP-NG ISO file](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification#extract-an-existing-iso-image)
3. Modify the boot configuration to use the remote answerfile
  * For BIOS boot, edit `/boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg`.
    * Locate the `install` boot entry, which should look like this:
    ```
    LABEL install
        KERNEL mboot.c32
        APPEND /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 --- /install.img
    ```
    * Append `answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to vmlinuz, before the last `---`:
    ```
    LABEL install
        KERNEL mboot.c32
        APPEND /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install --- /install.img
    ```
  * For UEFI boot edit `/EFI/xenserver/grub.cfg` (and `/EFI/xenserver/grub-usb.cfg` for USB installation).
    * Locate the `install` menuentry, which should look like this:
    ```
    menuentry "install" {
        multiboot2 /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
        module2 /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0
        module2 /install.img
    }
    ```
    * Append `answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to vmlinuz, in the line that starts with `module2 /boot/vmlinuz`:
    ```
    menuentry "install" {
        multiboot2 /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
        module2 /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=http://your_server/path/to/answerfile.xml install
        module2 /install.img
    }
    ```
4. [Build a new ISO with your changes](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification)

Your ISO is ready for installation.

#### Unattended installation ISO with embedded config

If can't either setup PXE or serve a file (the answerfile) from a server that will be available to the hosts during installation, you can create an automated installation image that will embed its own configuration. It's a bit more work and will need to be done again every time you want to modify the answerfile.

1. [Prepare an answerfile](../../appendix/answerfile)
2. [Extract the XCP-NG ISO file](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification#extract-an-existing-iso-image)
3. Modify the boot configuration to use a local (= embedded in the ISO) answerfile
  * For BIOS boot, edit `/boot/isolinux/isolinux.cfg`.
    * Locate the `install` boot entry, which should look like this:
    ```
    LABEL install
        KERNEL mboot.c32
        APPEND /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 --- /install.img
    ```
    * Append `answerfile=file:///answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to vmlinuz, before the last `---`:
    ```
    LABEL install
        KERNEL mboot.c32
        APPEND /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=file:///answerfile.xml install --- /install.img
    ```
  * For UEFI boot edit `/EFI/xenserver/grub.cfg` (and `/EFI/xenserver/grub-usb.cfg` for USB installation).
    * Locate the `install` menuentry, which should look like this:
    ```
    menuentry "install" {
        multiboot2 /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
        module2 /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0
        module2 /install.img
    }
    ```
    * Append `answerfile=file:///answerfile.xml install` to the parameters passed to vmlinuz, in the line that starts with `module2 /boot/vmlinuz`:
    ```
    menuentry "install" {
        multiboot2 /boot/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-16 dom0_mem=max:8192M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga
        module2 /boot/vmlinuz console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=file:///answerfile.xml install
        module2 /install.img
    }
    ```
4. [Extract install.img](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification#extract-an-existing-iso-image)
5. Add your answerfile
    ```
    cp answerfile.xml "$WORK_DIR/install/answerfile.xml"
    ```

6. [Build a new install.img with your changes](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification#build-a-new-installimg-with-your-changes)
7. [Build a new ISO with your changes](../../project/development-process/ISO-modification#build-a-new-iso-image-with-your-changes)

Your ISO is ready for installation.


### Software RAID in answerfile

For an automated install using an answer file, software raid can be enabled as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<installation mode="fresh" srtype="lvm">
    <raid device="md127">
        <disk>sda</disk>
        <disk>sdb</disk>
    </raid>
    <primary-disk>md127</primary-disk>
    <keymap>us</keymap>
    <source type="url">https://xcp-ng.org/install/</source>
    <admin-interface name="eth0" proto="dhcp" />
    <timezone>Europe/London</timezone>
    <root-password>secret</root-password>
</installation>
```

As an improvement and to delay the `md` resync (increasing install speed by about 500% on certain drives), we can use the following in the answer file:

```
<script stage="installation-start" type="url">http://your-server/noresync.sh</script>
```

The `noresync.sh` script would do something like this:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max
echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min
```

Upon server reboot, normal `md` resync will take place.

## Advanced installation options (installer command-line parameters)

The XCP-ng installer can be further parameterized to support advanced installation environments. The command line options are passed as parameters to the ```vmlinuz``` kernel of the installer.

### Definitions

#### "scriptlocation"

An URL pointing at a script. All URLs except for file:// trigger initialization of networking during the installer execution.

* file:/// - file inside the filesystem of the installer environment (i.e. ```install.img```)
* ftp:// - file on an FTP server, fetched with urllib2
* http:// - file on an HTTP server, fetched with urllib2
* https:// - file on an HTTPS server, fetched with urllib2
* nfs:// - file on an NFS server, the directory is mounted and the file accessed

A script is either XML (for ```answerfile=``` or ```rt_answerfile=```) or an executable script expected to begin with a shebang. The following interpreters are recognized.

* /bin/sh
* /bin/bash
* /usr/bin/python
* /usr/bin/env python

### Environment

#### sshpassword="password"

Start an ssh server during installation allowing root to log-on interactively with the given password.

### Behaviour

#### atexit=reboot|poweroff|shell

Action to perform when the installer is finished.

* poweroff - power off the system
* **reboot** (default) - reboot the sytem
* shell - drop to shell **after** running the installer. NB: The installation target is already unmounted.

#### bash-shell

See ```shell```.

#### console="devicename"

Use the named console device for the installer. Can be given multiple times.  
E.g. ```console=hvc0 console=tty0```

#### reboot

See ```atexit=reboot```.

#### shell

Start a shell **before** running the installer.

### Networking

If networking is required (e.g. to fetch an answerfile or access a repository) the installer will configure the detected network cards.

#### network_config=dhcp[:vlan="id"]

configure interface using DHCP optionally using a VLAN.

* vlan="id" - create a virtual interface tagging with vlan id backed by the underlying interfance.

#### network_config=static:"network configuration"

configure interface with provided static information. The configuration is a ; separated list of stanzas.

* **ip** (mandatory)="IP address"
* **netmask** (mandatory)="netmask"
* vlan="id" - create a virtual interface tagging with vlan id backed by the underlying interfance.
* gateway="gateway address" - use specified address as default route
* dns="DNS resolver address"[,"additional DNS resolver address"] -- use specified address(es) as resolvers 
* domain="domain name" - use specified domain name as search domain

#### network_device="eth"|"mac"|all

Bring up networking on the given interface(s) to allow installer to fetch network resources.

* "eth" - the name of a network interface
* "mac"-  the MAC address of a network interface
* **all** (default) - all network interfaces available to the installer's kernel environment 

### Automation

#### answerfile="scriptlocation"

Read the scriptlocation and perform non-interactive installation reporting status using screens interface. Cannot be used together with ```answerfile_generator=```.

#### rt_answerfile="scriptlocation"

Read the scriptlocation and perform non-interactive installation reporting status using simple text to the console. Cannot be used together with ```answerfile_generator=```.

#### answerfile_generator="scriptlocation"

Read the scriptlocation execute it and use its standard output as an answerfile to perform non-interactive installation. Cannot be used together with ```answerfile=``` or ```rt_answerfile=```.

#### answerfile_device=

See ```network_device=```.

We **strongly discourage** the installation of XCP-ng on USB drives. The frequent writing actions required by XCP-ng can rapidly degrade a USB drive due to:
* XAPI: This is the XenServer API database, which undergoes constant changes. This results in significant write operations, which are detrimental to the longevity of USB drives. Note: The XAPI database maintains the state of all XCP-ng operations and is replicated across each host (from the slave).
* Logs: XCP-ng generates a substantial amount of debug logs. A possible solution is to utilize a remote syslog.

### Installation on SD cards

:::danger
For similar reasons as USB drives, we highly recommend against installing XCP-ng on SD cards. Opting for even a basic SSD would be vastly more effective in managing the XCP-ng system.
