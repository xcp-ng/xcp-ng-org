## Backlog

### Compute

* Xen live patching
* Faster Xen Motion (compression in `xenops`?)
* VM migration improvement [#145](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/issues/145)
* more recent Xen in alternate repo
* MxGPU integration out-of-the-box
* Q35 support

### Storage

* SMAPIv3 qcow2 export/import
* SMAPIv3 new drivers
* VDI export with compression (including `zstd`)
* SMAPIv3 Ceph support
* Coalesce process improvement (raw speed, rewrite, multicore?) [#127](https://github.com/xcp-ng/xcp/issues/127)
* Faster Xen Storage Motion (using on the fly compression for disk content? remove stunnel?)
* SMAPIv3 full ZFS driver (using pyzfs with it)
* NVMe driver for near bare metal perfs (specification in progress)
* smarctl alerts (specification in progress)
* General storage perf improvement
* Thin pro on block based SR (architectural review needed)

### Network

* DPDK support

### API

* XAPI HTTP lib 1.1 replacement (removing stunnel)
* ISO upload in SR ISO
* JSON-RPC compression support

### Platform/Installer

* Conversion tool (facilitate migration to XCP-ng)
* Installer using `ext4` for dom0
* Installer allow join pool directly during install
* Expose repo URL/modification from XAPI (possibility to use XOA with `apt-cacher-ng`)
* Improved provisioning support (Ansibleâ€¦)
* Automated tests
* new RPM tracking in CentOS (Anitya)
