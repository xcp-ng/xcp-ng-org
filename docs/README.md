# XCP-ng documentation

XCP-ng is a high performance enterprise level virtualization platform with a rich ecosystem.

Originally based on [XenServer](https://xenserver.org/) (now [Citrix Hypervisor](https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-hypervisor/)), it's the result of massive cooperation between individuals and companies, to deliver a product without limits. No restrictions on features and every bit available on GitHub!
