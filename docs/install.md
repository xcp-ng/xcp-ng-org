# Installation

This guide will help you to set up XCP-ng.

## ISO installation

If you want to use the netinstall ISO, see the [Netinstall section](install.md#netinstall).

### Download and create media

You can download the 8.1 ISO here: <http://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.1/xcp-ng-8.1.0-2.iso>.

SHA256 checksums, GPG signatures and net-install ISO are available [here](https://xcp-ng.org/#easy-to-install).


Then, create the install media (e.g. USB key):

```
dd if=xcp-ng-8.1.0-2.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M oflag=direct
```

Finally, boot on that media and go to the next section.

:::tip
On Windows, you can use Rufus to create the bootable USB stick.
:::

### Start the host

Start the host and boot on the USB media.

### Follow instructions

#### 1. UEFI vs BIOS

Boot screens are just slightly different on start between BIOS and UEFI mode:

BIOS splash screen:

UEFI splash screen:

:::warning
NEVER switch from UEFI to BIOS (or vice-versa) **after** you installed XCP-ng. Stick to the mode that you chose during the install.
:::

#### 2. Language selection

#### 3. Welcome

#### 4. EULA/license

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install4.png)

#### 5. Disk selection

This is the screen where you'll select where XCP-ng system will be installed. **XCP-ng is a specialized Linux distribution**, so you need to dedicated a physical disk to it. Partitioning is done automatically.

Alternatively, if you have two identical disks, you can use Software RAID (`mdadm`) :

#### 6. VM storage selection

This is the place where your VM disks will be stored. It's called a **Storage Repository** (SR). It can use the same disk where you installed the system. It will automatically use the free space after system partitions.

:::tip
EXT instead of LVM? We advise to use EXT!
:::

#### 7. Installation source

If you use the default ISO, just select "Local media":

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install9.png)

Then, you can verify your media or not:

#### 8. Host password

This will be the **root** password, used to connect to the host with SSH and XAPI.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install11.png)

#### 9. Networking

Here you can select between DHCP and static network, even using a VLAN:

#### 10. Hostname and DNS

Configure the hostname of your server and the DNS resolvers.

![](https://xcp-ng.org/assets/img/screenshots/install13.png)

#### 11. Timezone and time

:::warning
ALWAYS use a NTP server. It's a critical component to manage your host(s). If you don't know any NTP server, you can use `pool.ntp.org`.

#### 12. Installation

:::warning
After this step, data will be written on the disk!

#### 13. Supplemental packs and end of install

Not relevant in almost all cases. Skip it:

:::tip
"Completing installation" is in fact installing the bootloader and building the initramfs. It can take time.

#### 14. Reboot

After a reboot, you should see the GRUB menu:

It means the system is correctly installed! Enjoy XCP-ng ðŸš€

## Netinstall

A netinstall is a lightweight ISO (around 150MiB) that will only contain the installer, but no actual RPM packages. Sometimes, it's more convenient/faster when your ISO is on a slow connection (e.g. a virtual media using a server IPMI).

You can download it on this URL: <http://mirrors.xcp-ng.org/isos/8.1/xcp-ng-8.1.0-2-netinstall.iso>.

As with the regular installation ISO, write it on an USB media:

```
dd if=xcp-ng-8.1.0-2-netinstall.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=8M oflag=direct
```

Everything else is like the [regular install](install.md#start-the-host), except that it will not offer to install from local media, only from distant ones.

## Automated install

### PXE

This is just an example with VirtualBox.

To test the PXE in a VirtualBox environment you'll need to populate the [PXE special folder](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#nat-tftp). Most of the content comes from the ISO image.
```
/Users/nraynaud/Library/Virtualbox/TFTP
â”œâ”€â”€ mboot.c32              <- from /boot/pxelinux
â”œâ”€â”€ menu.c32               <- from /boot/pxelinux
â”œâ”€â”€ pxelinux.cfg           <- mandatory name
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ default            <- config file
â”œâ”€â”€ test.pxe               <- this is pxelinux.0 (from /boot/pxelinux) renamed to vmname.pxe
â””â”€â”€ xcp-ng                 <- most of it comes from /boot
    â”œâ”€â”€ efiboot.img
    â”œâ”€â”€ gcdx64.efi
    â”œâ”€â”€ grubx64.efi
    â”œâ”€â”€ install.img        <- this is /install.img from the .iso
    â”œâ”€â”€ isolinux
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ boot.cat
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ isolinux.bin
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ isolinux.cfg
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mboot.c32
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ memtest
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ menu.c32
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pg_help
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pg_main
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ splash.lss
    â”œâ”€â”€ vmlinuz
    â””â”€â”€ xen.gz
```

The configuration file pxelinux.cfg/default is as follow:
```
default xenserver
label xenserver
kernel mboot.c32
append xcp-ng/xen.gz dom0_max_vcpus=1-2 dom0_mem=max:2048M com1=115200,8n1 console=com1,vga --- xcp-ng/vmlinuz xencons=hvc console=hvc0 console=tty0 answerfile=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/nraynaud/4cca5205c805394a34fc4170b3903113/raw/ install --- xcp-ng/install.img
```

Here is the beginning of an answer file:
```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<installation>
    <keymap>fr</keymap>
    <primary-disk>sda</primary-disk>
    <guest-disk>sda</guest-disk>
    <root-password>tototo2</root-password>
    <source type="local"></source>
    <admin-interface name="eth0" proto="dhcp" />
    <timezone>America/Phoenix</timezone>
</installation>
```
There is some more [documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-hypervisor/install/network-boot.html#create-an-answer-file-for-unattended-pxe-and-uefi-installation) on Citrix's website.
The answer file, sadly, can't be transmitted by TFTP (its protocol can only be ftp, http, https or file), so I used gist.
The installation files can come from the ISO disk, but don't forget to alter the boot order such that the network is first.

#### Software RAID

For an automated install using an answer file (PXE or similar required), software raid can be enabled as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<installation mode="fresh" srtype="lvm">
    <raid device="md127">
        <disk>sda</disk>
        <disk>sdb</disk>
    </raid>
    <primary-disk>md127</primary-disk>
    <keymap>us</keymap>
    <source type="url">https://xcp-ng.org/install/</source>
    <admin-interface name="eth0" proto="dhcp" />
    <timezone>Europe/London</timezone>
    <root-password>secret</root-password>
</installation>
```

As an improvement and to delay the `md` resync (increasing install speed by about 500% on certain drives), we can use the following in the answer file:

```
<script stage="installation-start" type="url">http://your-server/noresync.sh</script>
```

The `noresync.sh` script would do something like this:

```
#!/bin/sh
echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_max
echo 0 > /proc/sys/dev/raid/speed_limit_min
```

Upon server reboot, normal `md` resync will take place.

## Misc

#### Install on a USB stick

::: danger
We **strongly** advise against installing on USB stick. XCP-ng writes a lot into local files and this writing will wear out your USB-Stick in a short amount of time:
* XAPI: the XenServer API database is changing a lot. Hence writing a lot, and believe me, USB sticks aren't really happy with that on the long run. Note: XAPI DB is what keep tracks on all XCP-ng's "state", and it's replicated on each host (from the slave).
* Logs: XCP-ng keeps a LOT of debug logs. However, there is a workaround: use a remote syslog.
